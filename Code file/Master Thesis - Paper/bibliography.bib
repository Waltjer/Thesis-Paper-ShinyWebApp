  abstract = {At the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, we are witnessing a fast and widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our daily life, which contributes to accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society. However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on Explainable Artificial Intelligence. A research field that holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to explainable AI. Through the lens of literature, we review existing approaches regarding the topic, we discuss trends surrounding its sphere and we present major research trajectories.},

  abstract = {Down syndrome caused by chromosome 21 trisomy is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation in humans. Disruption of the phenotype is thought to be the result of gene-dosage imbalance. Variations in chromosome 21 gene expression in Down syndrome were analyzed in lymphoblastoid cells derived from patients and control individuals. Of the 359 genes and predictions displayed on a specifically designed high-content chromosome 21 microarray, one-third were expressed in lymphoblastoid cells. We performed a mixed-model analysis of variance to find genes that are differentially expressed in Down syndrome independent of sex and interindividual variations. In addition, we identified genes with variations between Down syndrome and control samples that were significantly different from the gene-dosage effect (1.5). Microarray data were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We found that 29\% of the expressed chromosome 21 transcripts are overexpressed in Down syndrome and correspond to either genes or open reading frames. Among these, 22\% are increased proportional to the gene-dosage effect, and 7\% are amplified. The other 71\% of expressed sequences are either compensated (56\%, with a large proportion of predicted genes and antisense transcripts) or highly variable among individuals (15\%). Thus, most of the chromosome 21 transcripts are compensated for the gene-dosage effect. Overexpressed genes are likely to be involved in the Down syndrome phenotype, in contrast to the compensated genes. Highly variable genes could account for phenotypic variations observed in patients. Finally, we show that alternative transcripts belonging to the same gene are similarly regulated in Down syndrome but sense and antisense transcripts are not.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Congenital anomalies are seen at 1-3\% of the population, probabilities of which are tried to be found out primarily through double, triple and quad tests during pregnancy. Also, ultrasonographical evaluations of fetuses enhance detecting and defining these abnormalities. About 60-70\% of the anomalies can be diagnosed via ultrasonography, while the remaining 30-40\% can be diagnosed after childbirth. Medical diagnosis and prediction is a topic that is closely related with e-Health and machine learning. e-Health applications are critically important especially for the patients unable to see a doctor or any health professional. Our objective is to help clinicians and families to better predict fetal congenital anomalies besides the traditional pregnancy tests using machine learning techniques and e-Health applications. METHODS: In this work, we developed a prediction system with assistive e-Health applications which both the pregnant women and practitioners can make use of. A performance comparison (considering Accuracy, F1-Score, AUC measures) was made between 9 binary classification models (Averaged Perceptron, Boosted Decision Tree, Bayes Point Machine, Decision Forest, Decision Jungle, Locally-Deep Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Support Vector Machine) which were trained with the clinical dataset of 96 pregnant women and used to process data to predict fetal anomaly status based on the maternal and clinical data. The dataset was obtained through maternal questionnaire and detailed evaluations of 3 clinicians from RadyoEmar radiodiagnostics center in Istanbul, Turkey. Our e-Health applications are used to get pregnant women's health status and clinical history parameters as inputs, recommend them physical activities to perform during pregnancy, and inform the practitioners and finally the patients about possible risks of fetal anomalies as the output. RESULTS: In this paper, the highest accuracy of prediction was displayed as 89.5\% during the development tests with Decision Forest model. In real life testing with 16 users, the performance was 87.5\%. This estimate is sufficient to give an idea of fetal health before the patient visits the physician. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed work aims to provide assistive services to pregnant women and clinicians via an online system consisting of a mobile side for the patients, a web application side for their clinicians and a prediction system. In addition, we showed the impact of certain clinical data parameters of pregnant on the fetal health status, statistically correlated the parameters with the existence of fetal anomalies and showed guidelines for future researches.},

Supervised classification is one of the tasks most frequently carried out by the intelligent systems. This paper describes various Supervised Machine Learning (ML) classification techniques, compares various supervised learning algorithms as well as determines the most efficient classification algorithm based on the data set, the number of instances and variables (features). Seven different machine learning algorithms were considered:Decision Table, Random Forest (RF) , Na{\"i}ve Bayes (NB) , Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks (Perceptron), JRip and Decision Tree (J48) using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) machine learning tool. To implement the algorithms, Diabetes data set was used for the classification with 786 instances with eight attributes as independent variable and one as dependent variable for the analysis. The results show that SVM was found to be the algorithm with most precision and accuracy. Na{\"i}ve Bayes and Random Forest classification algorithms were found to be the next accurate after SVM accordingly. The research shows that time taken to build a model and precision (accuracy) is a factor on one hand; while kappa statistic and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is another factor on the other hand. Therefore, ML algorithms requires precision, accuracy and minimum error to have supervised predictive machine learning.},

  abstract = {Thalassemia is considered one of the most common genetic blood disorders that has received excessive attention in the medical research fields worldwide. Under this context, one of the greatest challenges for healthcare professionals is to correctly differentiate normal individuals from asymptomatic thalassemia carriers. Usually, thalassemia diagnosis is based on certain measurable characteristic changes to blood cell counts and related indices. These characteristic changes can be derived easily when performing a complete blood count test (CBC) using a special fully automated blood analyzer or counter. However, the reliability of the CBC test alone is questionable with possible candidate characteristics that could be seen in other disorders, leading to misdiagnosis of thalassemia. Therefore, other costly and time-consuming tests should be performed that may cause serious consequences due to the delay in the correct diagnosis. To help overcoming these challenging diagnostic issues, this work presents a new novel dataset collected from Palestine Avenir Foundation for persons tested for thalassemia. We aim to compile a gold standard dataset for thalassemia and make it available for researchers in this field. Moreover, we use this dataset to predict the specific type of thalassemia known as beta thalassemia ({$\beta$}-thalassemia) based on hybrid data mining model. The proposed model consists of two main steps. First, to overcome the problem of the highly imbalanced class distribution in the dataset, a balancing technique called SMOTE is proposed and applied to handle this problem. In the second step, four classification models, namely k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), na{\"i}ve Bayesian (NB), decision tree (DT) and the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network are used to differentiate between normal persons and those patients carrying {$\beta$}-thalassemia. Different evaluation metrics are used to assess the performance of the proposed model. The experimental results show that the SMOTE oversampling method can effectively improve the identification ratio of {$\beta$}-thalassemia carriers in a highly imbalanced class distribution. The results reveal also that the NB classifier achieved the best performance in differentiating between normal and {$\beta$}-thalassemia carriers at oversampling SMOTE ratio of 400\%. This combination shows a specificity of 99.47\% and a sensitivity of 98.81\%.},

The risk factors include raised blood pressure, dyslipidemia (raised triglycerides and lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), raised fasting glucose, and central obesity. Various diagnostic criteria have been proposed by different organizations over the past decade. Most recently, these have come from the International Diabetes Federation and the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The main difference concerns the measure for central obesity, with this being an obligatory component in the International Diabetes Federation definition, lower than in the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria, and ethnic specific. The present article represents the outcome of a meeting between several major organizations in an attempt to unify criteria. It was agreed that there should not be an obligatory component, but that waist measurement would continue to be a useful preliminary screening tool. Three abnormal findings out of 5 would qualify a person for the metabolic syndrome. A single set of cut points would be used for all components except waist circumference, for which further work is required. In the interim, national or regional cut points for waist circumference can be used.},

The first layer is used to differentiate between pathological and non-pathological cases while the second layer is used to discriminate between two different pathologies ({$\alpha$}-thalassemia carrier against {$\beta$}-thalassemia carrier) from the first output layer (pathological cases). Using the parameters sensitivity (percentage of pathologic cases correctly classified) and specificity (percentage of non-pathologic cases correctly classified), the results obtained with this analysis show that the MLP classifier gives slightly better results than SVM although the amount of data available is limited. Both techniques enable thalassemia carriers to be discriminated from healthy subjects with 95\% specificity, although the sensitivity of MLP is 92\% while that of SVM is 83\%.},

The most common defects among the population affect the genes that are involved in the synthesis of alpha and beta chains. The main aspects of these pathologies are well explained from a biochemical and genetic point of view. The diagnosis is fundamentally based on hematologic and genetic tests. A genetic analysis is particularly important to determine the carriers of alpha-thalassemia, whose identification by means of the hematologic parameters is more difficult in comparison with heterozygotes for alpha-thalassemia. This work investigates the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the classification of thalassemic pathologies using the hematologic parameters resulting from hemochromocytometric analysis only. Different combinations of ANNs are reported, which allow thalassemia carriers to be discriminated from normals with 94\% classification accuracy, 92\% sensitivity, and 95\% specificity. On the basis of these results, an automated system that allows real-time support for diagnoses is proposed. The automated system interfaces a hemochromo analyzer to a simple PC.},

A wide variety of prenatal screening and diagnostic tests are available; each offers varying levels of information and performance, and each has relative advantages and limitations. When considering screening test characteristics, no one test is superior in all circumstances, which results in the need for nuanced, patient-centered counseling from the obstetric care professional and complex decision making by the patient. Each patient should be counseled in each pregnancy about options for testing for fetal chromosomal abnormalities. It is important that obstetric care professionals be prepared to discuss not only the risk of fetal chromosomal abnormalities but also the relative benefits and limitations of the available screening and diagnostic tests. Testing for chromosomal abnormalities should be an informed patient choice based on provision of adequate and accurate information, the patient's clinical context, accessible health care resources, values, interests, and goals. All patients should be offered both screening and diagnostic tests, and all patients have the right to accept or decline testing after counseling.The purpose of this Practice Bulletin is to provide current information regarding the available screening test options available for fetal chromosomal abnormalities and to review their benefits, performance characteristics, and limitations.

  abstract = {Trisomy 21, the presence of a supernumerary chromosome 21, results in a collection of clinical features commonly known as Down syndrome (DS). DS is among the most genetically complex of the conditions that are compatible with human survival post-term, and the most frequent survivable autosomal aneuploidy. Mouse models of DS, involving trisomy of all or part of~human chromosome 21 or orthologous mouse genomic regions, are providing valuable insights into the contribution of triplicated genes or groups of genes to the many clinical manifestations in DS. This endeavour is challenging, as there are {$>$}200 protein-coding genes on chromosome 21 and~they can have direct and indirect effects on homeostasis in cells, tissues, organs and systems. Although this complexity poses formidable challenges to understanding the~underlying molecular basis for each of the many clinical features of DS, it also provides opportunities for improving understanding of genetic mechanisms underlying the development and function of many cell types, tissues, organs and systems. Since the first description of trisomy 21, we have learned much about intellectual disability and genetic risk factors for congenital heart disease. The lower occurrence of solid tumours in individuals with DS supports the identification of chromosome 21 genes that protect against cancer when overexpressed. The universal occurrence of the histopathology of Alzheimer disease and the high prevalence of dementia in DS are providing insights into the pathology and treatment of Alzheimer disease. Clinical trials to ameliorate intellectual disability in DS signal a new era in which therapeutic interventions based on knowledge of the molecular pathophysiology of DS can now be explored; these efforts provide reasonable hope for the future.},

  abstract = {Objective The global burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) is expected to increase by 60\% to more than 2.2 million new cases and 1.1 million deaths by 2030. In this study, we aim to describe the recent CRC incidence and mortality patterns and trends linking the findings to the prospects of reducing the burden through cancer prevention and care. Design Estimates of sex-specific CRC incidence and mortality rates in 2012 were extracted from the GLOBOCAN database. Temporal patterns were assessed for 37 countries using data from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5) volumes I--X and the WHO mortality database. Trends were assessed via the annual percentage change using joinpoint regression and discussed in relation to human development levels. Results CRC incidence and mortality rates vary up to 10-fold worldwide, with distinct gradients across human development levels, pointing towards widening disparities and an increasing burden in countries in transition. Generally, CRC incidence and mortality rates are still rising rapidly in many low-income and middle-income countries; stabilising or decreasing trends tend to be seen in highly developed countries where rates remain among the highest in the world. Conclusions Patterns and trends in CRC incidence and mortality correlate with present human development levels and their incremental changes might reflect the adoption of more western lifestyles. Targeted resource-dependent interventions, including primary prevention in low-income, supplemented with early detection in high-income settings, are needed to reduce the number of patients with CRC in future decades.},

The results of this study are presented in two parts. Objective 1 is summarized in the preceding paper and objectives 2 and 3 are summarized here. Comprehensive interviews were conducted with 80 women, who had given birth to a child diagnosed with FAS, to document their sociodemographics, reproductive and family planning history, social and healthcare utilization patterns, adverse social experiences, social support network, alcohol use and treatment history, mental health, and intelligence quotient (IQ). These high-risk women were diverse in racial, educational and economic backgrounds, were often victims of abuse, and challenged by mental health issues. Despite their rather harsh psychosocial profile, many demonstrated the ability to overcome their alcohol dependence over time. Relative to the women who had not achieved abstinence, the women who had achieved abstinence had significantly higher IQs, higher household incomes, larger more satisfactory social support networks, were more likely to report a religious affiliation, and were more likely to be receiving mental health treatment for their mental health disorders. The rate of unintended pregnancies and alcohol-exposed pregnancies was substantial. Key barriers to achieving effective family planning were maternal alcohol and drug use, lack of access to birth control and lack of support by their partner to use birth control. A FAS diagnostic and prevention clinic can be used to identify women at high risk for producing children damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. Primary prevention programmes targeted to this population could lead to measurable reductions in the incidence of FAS.},

  abstract = {Alpha ({$A$}) thalassaemia is the most common inherited disorder in Malaysia. The clinical severity is dependant on the number of {$A$} genes involved. Full blood count (FBC) and haemoglobin (Hb) analysis using either gel electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or capillary zone electrophoresis (CE) are unable to detect definitively alpha thalassaemia carriers. Definitive diagnosis of {$A$}-thalassaemias requires molecular analysis and methods of detecting both common deletional and non-deletional molecular abnormailities are easily performed in any laboratory involved in molecular diagnostics. We carried out a retrospective analysis of 1623 cases referred to our laboratory in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC) for the diagnosis of {$A$}-thalassaemia during the period October 2001 to December 2012. We examined the frequency of different types of alpha gene abnormalities and their haematologic features. Molecular diagnosis was made using a combination of multiplex polymerase reaction (PCR) and real time PCR to detect deletional and non-deletional alpha genes relevant to southeast Asian population. Genetic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of {$A$}-thalassaemias in 736 cases. Majority of the cases were Chinese (53.1\%) followed by Malays (44.2\%), and Indians (2.7\%). The most common gene abnormality was {$AA$}/--(SEA) (64.0\%) followed by {$AA$}/-{$A$}(3.7) (19.8\%), -{$A$}(3.7) /--(SEA) (6.9\%), {$AA$}/{$AA$}CS (3.0\%), --(SEA)/--(SEA) (1.2\%), -{$A$}(3.7)/-{$A$}(3.7) (1.1\%), {$AA$}/-{$A$}(4.2) (0.7\%), -{$A$}(4.2)/--(SEA (0.7\%), -{$A$}(3.7)/-{$A$}(4.2) (0.5\%), {$AA$}(CS)/-- SEA) (0.4\%), {$AA$}(CS)/{$AA$}(Cd59) (0.4\%), {$AA$}(CS)/{$AA$}(CS) (0.4\%), -{$A$}(3.7)/{$AA$}(Cd59) (0.3\%), {$AA$}/{$AA$}(Cd59) (0.1\%), {$AA$}(Cd59)/ {$AA$}(IVS I-1) (0.1\%), -{$A$}(3.7)/{$AA$}(CS) (0.1\%) and --(SEA) /{$AA$}(Cd59) (0.1\%). This data indicates that the molecular abnormalities of {$A$}-thalassaemia in the Malaysian population is heterogenous. Although {$A$}-gene deletion is the most common cause, non-deletional {$A$}-gene abnormalities are not uncommon and at least 3 different mutations exist. Establishment of rapid and easy molecular techniques is important for definitive diagnosis of alpha thalassaemia, an important prerequisite for genetic counselling to prevent its deleterious complications.},

  abstract = {Thalassemias are a heterogeneous grouping of genetic disorders that result from a decreased~synthesis of alpha or beta chains of hemoglobin (Hb). Hemoglobin serves as the oxygen-carrying component of the red blood cells. It consists of two proteins, an alpha, and a beta. If the body does not manufacture enough of one or the other of these two proteins, the red blood cells do not form correctly and cannot carry sufficient oxygen; this causes anemia that begins in early childhood and lasts throughout life. Thalassemia is an inherited disease, meaning that at least one of the parents must be a carrier for the disease. It is caused by either a genetic mutation or a deletion of certain key gene fragments. Alpha thalassemia is caused by alpha-globin gene deletion which results in reduced or absent production of alpha-globin chains. Alpha globin gene has 4 alleles and disease severity ranges from mild to severe depending on the number of deletions of the alleles. Four allele deletion is the most severe form in which no alpha globins are produced and the excess gamma chains (present during the fetal period) form tetramers. It is incompatible with life and results in hydrops fetalis. One allele deletion is the mildest form and is mostly clinically silent. Beta thalassemia results from point mutations in the beta-globin gene. It is divided into three categories based on the zygosity of the beta-gene mutation. A heterozygous mutation (beta-plus thalassemia) results in beta-thalassemia minor in which beta chains are underproduced. It is mild and usually asymptomatic. Beta thalassemia major is caused by a homozygous mutation (beta-zero thalassemia) of the beta-globin gene, resulting in the total absence of beta chains. It manifests clinically as jaundice, growth retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, endocrine abnormalities, and severe anemia requiring life-long blood transfusions. The condition in between these two types is called beta-thalassemia intermedia with mild to moderate clinical symptoms.~: One mutated gene: Mild signs and symptoms. The condition is called thalassemia minor. Two mutated genes:~Signs and symptoms will be moderate to severe. This condition is called thalassemia major, or Cooley anemia. Babies born with two mutated beta hemoglobin genes are usually healthy at birth but~disease starts to manifest after 6 months of life when fetal hemoglobin (Hb-gamma) disappears and is replaced by adult Hb. The excess unpaired alpha-globin chains in beta-thalassemia aggregate and form precipitates that damage red cell membranes and result in intravascular hemolysis. This premature death of erythroid precursor cells leads to ineffective erythropoiesis and later results in extramedullary expansion of hematopoiesis.~ Coinheritance of alpha thalassemia:~Beta-thalassemia patients with coinheritance of alpha thalassemia have a milder clinical course due to a less severe alpha-beta chain imbalance. Coexistence of sickle cell trait:~The presence of sickle cell trait with beta-thalassemia is a major hemoglobinopathy and results in manifestations of sickle cell disease. Unlike sickle cell trait in which major Hb is HbA, in the co-existence state the major Hb is HbS which constitutes more than 60\% of Hb~depending on the nature of the disease (beta-zero or beta-plus0.) Hemoglobin (HbE) is also a common Hb variant found in Southeast Asia population. It has a correlation with a beta-thalassemia phenotype, as people with thalassemia in this territory are commonly found to have HbE.~~ Two new terminologies being used more often in clinical settings are transfusion requiring and non-transfusion requiring thalassemias and all the basic classification falls into these two types depending on the requirement of frequent blood transfusions or not.},

This question is reviewed in the light of connectionist models of unsupervised learning and some older ideas, namely the cognitive maps and working models of Tolman and Craik, and the idea that redundancy is important for understanding perception (Attneave 1954), the physiology of sensory pathways (Barlow 1959), and pattern recognition (Watanabe 1960). It is argued that (1) The redundancy of sensory messages provides the knowledge incorporated in the maps or models. (2) Some of this knowledge can be obtained by observations of mean, variance, and covariance of sensory messages, and perhaps also by a method called ``minimum entropy coding.'' (3) Such knowledge may be incorporated in a model of ``what usually happens'' with which incoming messages are automatically compared, enabling unexpected discrepancies to be immediately identified. (4) Knowledge of the sort incorporated into such a filter is a necessary prerequisite of ordinary learning, and a representation whose elements are independent makes it possible to form associations with logical functions of the elements, not just with the elements themselves.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although methadone maintenance is effective in reducing injection drug use, needle sharing, and the overall mortality associated with opiate abuse, many health plans offer little or no access to methadone, and many methadone providers do not comply with treatment guidelines regarding dose, duration of treatment, or provision of ancillary services. Moral and political judgments have helped shape the U.S. treatment system. Evaluations of methadone cost-effectiveness may play a role in changing public policy. METHOD: Cost-effectiveness analysis is used to compare a change, or changes, in treatment to that of current standard care. The cost of treatment and its effect on outcomes are used to find the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and determine whether the change(s) should be adopted. The literature on methadone maintenance is reviewed from an economic perspective, focusing on five policy questions: (1) whether methadone should be a health care benefit; (2) what level of ancillary services is optimal; (3) what methadone dose is appropriate; (4) what length of treatment is appropriate; and (5) whether contingency contracts should be employed. RESULTS: Expanded access to methadone maintenance has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than \$11,000 per Quality-Adjusted Life Year. This is more cost-effective than many widely used medical therapies, a finding that strongly supports the inclusion of methadone in the formulary of health care plans.Ancillary services have been shown to be an effective part of methadone maintenance therapy, especially during the beginning of a treatment episode, but there is not enough information available to tell whether the optimal amount of services is being used. There is extensive evidence that many treatment programs dispense inadequate doses of methadone. The cost of additional drugs is very small compared to the benefits of an adequate dose. Many methadone programs limit treatment to 6 months or less, but such short episodes are not likely to be cost-effective. The medical model of methadone maintenance may increase the cost-effectiveness of the treatment for long-term patients. Programs that reward patients for negative urinalysis have proven effective at reducing illicit drug use, but their cost-effectiveness will need to be demonstrated before they are widely adopted. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness researchers need to measure substance abuse outcomes in terms of Quality-Adjusted Life Years, as this will make their findings more relevant to the development of treatment policy. It will allow different substance abuse treatments to be compared to each other and to medical care interventions.},

One minute Apgar scores were significantly lower in C-section and breech deliveries. There were more small for gestational age babies than in the general population, but most of the low birth weight newborns were small for gestational age, unlike the general population. Survival in this group of children was better than in other studies due to ascertainment bias. There were more girls than boys at all ages for both conditions, and the sex ratio decreased with time. Growth curves for length, weight, head circumference, and weight vs height are provided. Long-term survival did not appear to be due to mosaicism. We found no adverse reactions attributable to immunizations. At age 1 year there was an average of approximately 2 operations per living child.

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 112 pregnant women were referred to Fetal Medicine Unit of Hacettepe University Hospital for fetal ultrasonography and chromosome analysis with different indications. All patients underwent genetic amniocentesis or fetal blood sampling under ultrasound guidance. Gross malformations and hydrops fetalis were detected in 15 and 5 fetuses, respectively. We have found chromosomal abnormality in 7 cases. 'Triple Test' is offered to all patients and serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin and unconjugated estriol were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. In this study, we have used supervised artificial neural network structure to develop a diagnostic system. Our system's input parameters are maternal age, gestational age and 'Triple Test' results. Our system consists of two different artificial neural network modules whose decision-making logics are different. One of them is designed to search genetical disorders while the other one is for the assessment of fetal well-being. Confusion matrix is used for statistical evaluation. RESULTS: The discriminatory power of the artificial neural network to search genetical disorders and fetal well-being is found to be highly significant (z = 10.583 and z = 10.424, respectively). CONCLUSION: This system brings objectively to the evaluation of 'Triple Test' results and can be used both for the detection of genetical disorders and fetal well-being. Nevertheless, the analysis program's performance is limited to input information and knowledge and medical expert expert can not get more than he or she has donated the system.},

  abstract = {The Genetic Sonogram is an ultrasound examination done on second trimester fetuses that not only evaluates the fetus for structural malformations, but also searches for the sonographic markers of fetal Down syndrome. The main markers that comprise the genetic sonogram include the nuchal fold, short femur and humerus, pyelectasis, hyperechoic bowel, echogenic intracardiac focus, and any major abnormality. The absence of any marker on a second trimester scan conveys a 60-80\% reduction in prior risk of Down syndrome based on advanced maternal age or serum screen risk. The presence of sonographic markers, either singly or in combination, will raise the baseline risk of Down syndrome using likelihood ratios calculated for each individual marker. Using this approach, approximately 75\% of fetuses with Down syndrome can be identified by modifying the patient's baseline risk according to the results of the ultrasound. The second trimester scan will likely continue to play an important role in the future in the detection of aneuploidy.},

We updated to 2007 colorectal cancer mortality trends in Europe using data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Rates were analyzed for the overall population and separately in young, middle-age and elderly populations. In the European Union (EU), between 1997 and 2007 mortality from colorectal cancer declined by around 2\% per year, from 19.7 to 17.4/100,000 men (world standardized rates) and from 12.5 to 10.5/100,000 women. Persisting favorable trends were observed in countries of western and northern Europe, while there were more recent declines in several countries of eastern Europe, including the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia particularly in women (but not Romania and the Russian Federation). In 2007, a substantial excess in colorectal cancer mortality was still observed in Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia in men (rates over 25/100,000), and in Hungary, Norway, Denmark and Slovakia in women (rates over 14/100,000). Colorectal mortality trends were more favorable in the young (30--49 years) from most European countries, with a decline of {$\sim$}2\% per year since the early 1990s in both men and women from the EU. The recent decreases in colorectal mortality rates in several European countries are likely due to improvements in (early) diagnosis and treatment, with a consequent higher survival from the disease. Interventions to further reduce colorectal cancer burden are, however, still warranted, particularly in eastern European countries.},

Costs were further stratified by the presence or absence of a congenital heart defect (CHD). RESULTS: The mean medical costs for infants and children with Down syndrome were \$36384 during 2004; median medical costs were \$11164. Mean and median medical costs for children 0 to 4 years of age with Down syndrome were 12 to 13 times higher than for children without Down syndrome. For infants with Down syndrome and CHDs, mean and median costs were 5 to 7 times higher than for infants with Down syndrome who did not have CHDs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may facilitate future assessments of the effect of the Down syndrome on the health care system.},

  abstract = {Millions of people worldwide suffer from diseases that lead to paralysis through disruption of signal pathways between the brain and the muscles. Neuroprosthetic devices are designed to restore lost function and could be used to form an electronic 'neural bypass' to circumvent disconnected pathways in the nervous system. It has previously been shown that intracortically recorded signals can be decoded to extract information related to motion, allowing non-human primates and paralysed humans to control computers and robotic arms through imagined movements. In non-human primates, these types of signal have also been used to drive activation of chemically paralysed arm muscles. Here we show that intracortically recorded signals can be linked in real-time to muscle activation to restore movement in a paralysed human. We used a chronically implanted intracortical microelectrode array to record multiunit activity from the motor cortex in a study participant with quadriplegia from cervical spinal cord injury. We applied machine-learning algorithms to decode the neuronal activity and control activation of the participant's forearm muscles through a custom-built high-resolution neuromuscular electrical stimulation system. The system provided isolated finger movements and the participant achieved continuous cortical control of six different wrist and hand motions. Furthermore, he was able to use the system to complete functional tasks relevant to daily living. Clinical assessment showed that, when using the system, his motor impairment improved from the fifth to the sixth cervical (C5-C6) to the seventh cervical to first thoracic (C7-T1) level unilaterally, conferring on him the critical abilities to grasp, manipulate, and release objects. This is the first demonstration to our knowledge of successful control of muscle activation using intracortically recorded signals in a paralysed human. These results have significant implications in advancing neuroprosthetic technology for people worldwide living with the effects of paralysis.},

  abstract = {The value of the measurement of nuchal translucency thickness for predicting fetal Down's syndrome and other aneuploidies was prospectively evaluated at 8--15 weeks of gestation in 1819 consecutive pregnancies scheduled for karyotyping by chorionic villus sampling. In 43 cases, a chromosomal unbalanced aberration was found. Two teams of ultrasonologists who examined patients attending either National Health Service (Series 1) or private practice clinics (Series 2) were involved in the study. The same type of ultrasound machine and standardized approach were used in both study groups. In those cases in which the maximum subcutaneous thickness of the translucency was 3 mm or greater, the incidence of chromosomal aberration was 18.6\% compared to 1.7\% in the cases in which this was below 3 mm. The sensitivity, specificity and relative risk for all aneuploidies were 30\%, 96\% and 10.83, respectively, and no difference was found between trisomy 21 and other types of aneuploidy. The sensitivity and specificity and relative risk were significantly higher at 9--10 weeks than between 11 and 15 weeks. The results were concordant in the two series; however, the overall values for sensitivity (20\% vs. 39\%), specificity (94\% vs. 98\%) and relative risk (4.13 vs. 24.20) were clearly higher in the group of private patients. The results obtained confirm the potential application of the measurement of nuchal translucency thickness for fetal aneuploidy screening before the end of the first trimester and suggest that a multiplicity of individual, structural and organizational factors may interact and play a crucial role in determining the actual efficiency of ultrasound screening programs.

  abstract = {The thalassemias can be defined as {$\alpha$}- or {$\beta$}-thalassemias depending on the defective globin chain and on the underlying molecular defects. The recognition of carriers is possible by hematological tests. Both {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-thalassemia carriers (heterozygotes) present with microcytic hypochromic parameters with or without mild anemia. Red cell indices and morphology followed by separation and measurement of Hb fractions are the basis for identification of carriers. In addition, iron status should be ascertained by ferritin or zinc protoporphyrin measurements and the iron/total iron-binding capacity/saturation index. Mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin are markedly reduced (mean corpuscular volume: 60--70 fl; MCH: 19--23 pg) in {$\beta$}-thalassemia carriers, whereas a slight to relevant reduction is usually observed in {$\alpha$}-carriers. HbA2 determination is the most decisive test for {$\beta$}-carrier detection although it can be disturbed by the presence of {$\delta$}-thalassemia defects. In {$\alpha$}-thalassemia, HbA2 can be lower than normal and it assumes significant value when iron deficiency is excluded. Several algorithms have been introduced to discriminate from thalassemia carriers and subjects with iron-deficient anemia; because the only discriminating parameter is the red cell counts, these formulas must be used consciously. Molecular analysis is not required to confirm the diagnosis of {$\beta$}-carrier, but it is necessary to confirm the {$\alpha$}-thalassemia carrier status. The molecular diagnosis is essential to predict severe transfusion-dependent and intermediate-to-mild non-transfusion-dependent cases. DNA analysis on chorionic villi is the approach for prenatal diagnosis and the methods are the same used for mutations detection, according to the laboratory facilities and expertise.},

There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6\% of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4\% of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6\%), prostate cancer (7.1\%), and colorectal cancer (6.1\%) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2\%), stomach cancer (8.2\%), and liver cancer (8.2\%) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high-quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence-based cancer control programs, are not available in most low- and middle-income countries. The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development is an international partnership that supports better estimation, as well as the collection and use of local data, to prioritize and evaluate national cancer control efforts.

What little empirical research exists on this question is inadequate and mixed in its results. The present research was designed to overcome these problems by using a large, broad-based sample, a theoretically based bipolar measure of gender role identity, and course grade point average (GPA) across a number of academic subjects. A study of 1,688 sixth, seventh, and eight graders shows that the degree of masculinity or femininity of their gender identities accounts for a significant portion of their school grades. The pattern that is found across all subject areas shows that the more feminine the gender identity of both boys and girls, the better their performance as measured by GPA in classes. This pattern remains constant across controls for sex, race, grade, and sex of teacher. Although gender identity has significant effects, there remain sizable sex differences in performance which are not related to gender identity but which, because of their patterning, seem to be social in origin.}

This article discusses the major prevention programs that are set up in many countries in Europe, Asia, and Australia, often drawing from the experience in Sardinia. These comprehensive programs involve carrier detections, molecular diagnostics, genetic counseling, and prenatal diagnosis. Variability of clinical severity can be attributable to interactions with {$\alpha$}-thalassemia and mutations that increase fetal productions.

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: At the time of diagnosis of the trisomy 18 and trisomy 13, parents and care providers face difficult and challenging decisions regarding management. Because of the increased infant mortality and developmental outcome associated with both conditions, the conventional approach to management has been to withhold technological support. In recent years, an active dialogue on this topic has emerged. The purpose of this review is to summarize the literature on the outcome of infants with trisomy 18 and 13 and to discuss the key themes in this emerging dialogue. RECENT FINDINGS: In recent years, several important studies have appeared that have analyzed the issues relevant to this topic, including parental autonomy, best interest of the child standard, and quality of life. Some authorities state that in areas of ambiguity it is best to defer to parents' views, whereas others indicate concern that the best interest standard has given way to parental autonomy. Information on the actual experience of parents of children with trisomy 18 and 13 has been limited until recently. SUMMARY: The author recommends a balanced approach to counseling families of the newborn with trisomy 18 and 13 at the time of diagnosis. The counseling process should include presentation of accurate survival figures, avoidance of language that assumes outcome, communication of developmental outcome that does not presuppose perception of quality of life, and respect for the family's choice, whether it be comfort care or intervention.},

  abstract = {Previous reviews have highlighted parent--child connectedness and communication as important protective factors against adolescent substance use. However, these reviews focus on single substances such as alcohol. An integrative review of the literature was conducted to examine which elements of parent--child connectedness and substance-use specific communication are effective across adolescent alcohol, tobacco and drug use. Forty-two English language, peer reviewed articles were reviewed. Open communication occurs within the context of high connectedness between parents and their children. Conversations about health risks are associated with lower levels of substance use while more frequent conversations, those about parents' own use, permissive messages and consequences of use are associated with higher levels of use. There are disparities regarding conversations about use of each substance: alcohol and tobacco are easier topics of conversation while drug use is rarely discussed. Parental alcohol and tobacco use can influence the credibility of their communication with their child. Parents should be encouraged to have open, constructive, credible, two-sided conversations with their adolescents about substance use. Interventions to improve parents' communication skills around substance use, particularly drug use, should include the types of approaches and messages highlighted in this review, and, where possible, these interventions should include all family members.},

The reason for this is that ANNs are good approximates of complex functions, so classification can be performed without the need for explicitly defined input-output model. This engineering tool can be applied for optimization of existing methods for disease/syndrome classification. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses are the most frequent tests used in prenatal diagnostic for the early detection of Turner, Klinefelter, Patau, Edwards and Down syndrome. These procedures can be lengthy, repetitive; and often employ invasive techniques so a robust automated method for classifying and reporting prenatal diagnostics would greatly help the clinicians with their routine work. METHODS: The database consisted of data collected from 2500 pregnant woman that came to the Institute of Gynecology, Infertility and Perinatology "Mehmedbasic" for routine antenatal care between January 2000 and December 2016. During first trimester all women were subject to screening test where values of maternal serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and free beta human chorionic gonadotropin ({$\beta$}-hCG) were measured. Also, fetal nuchal translucency thickness and the presence or absence of the nasal bone was observed using ultrasound. RESULTS: The architectures of linear feedforward and feedback neural networks were investigated for various training data distributions and number of neurons in hidden layer. Feedback neural network architecture out performed feedforward neural network architecture in predictive ability for all five aneuploidy prenatal syndrome classes. Feedforward neural network with 15 neurons in hidden layer achieved classification sensitivity of 92.00\%. Classification sensitivity of feedback (Elman's) neural network was 99.00\%.

  abstract = {Objective To investigate whether amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling increase the risk of bleeding, placental abruption, complications related to amniotic cavity and membranes, abnormal labour, operative deliveries and to investigate the impact of gestational length at the time of the procedure. Design A population-based cohort study. Setting Sweden, 1991--1996. Population All women, 35 to 49 years old, with single births (N = 71,586). The women were classified as exposed to amniocentesis (N = 21,748) or chorionic villus sampling (N = 1984) or not exposed (N = 47,854). Methods Maternal outcomes were collected from the Swedish Medical Birth Register and the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register. With Logistic regression analyses odds ratios were calculated. Main outcome measures Crude and adjusted odds ratios of bleeding, complications related to amniotic cavity and membranes, abnormal labour and operative deliveries. Women exposed to amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling were compared with women non-exposed. Results Neither amniocentesis nor chorionic villus sampling was associated with severe pregnancy complications such as placental abruption or placenta praevia. Women in the amniocentesis group had a lower chance of normal delivery (OR = 0.93, 95\% CI 0.90--0.97), an increased risk of complications related to amniotic cavity and membranes (OR = 1.15, 95\% CI 1.06--1.24) and hypotonic uterine dysfunction (OR = 1.12, 95\% CI 1.06--1.18). The risks were higher for amniocentesis before 15 weeks of gestation. Women in the amniocentesis group were more often delivered by forceps or vacuum extractions (OR = 1.11, 95\% CI 1.03--1.19) and elective caesarean sections (OR = 1.09, 95\% CI 1.02--1.16). For the chorionic villus sampling group, no significant associations were found. Conclusions Among women aged 35--49 years, amniocentesis is not associated with important adverse outcomes such as abruption or placenta praevia. Minor associations were found for other maternal complications when amniocentesis was performed before 15 weeks of gestation. Improved methods to identify women with increased risk of chromosomally abnormal pregnancies might minimise the number of women exposed to invasive procedures.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Prenatal screening for Down syndrome (DS) is a routine part of prenatal care in many countries, and there is growing interest in the choices women make following a prenatal diagnosis of DS. This review describes what is known about actual and hypothetical decision making following a prenatal diagnosis of DS and adds understanding about the factors that influence women's decision making. Methods: A search of empirical studies was conducted through electronic databases, major journals, and reference lists that were published in English between January 1999 and September 2010. Inclusion criteria were that the research explored attitudes toward continuation of pregnancy or induced abortion for DS and included at least 1 variable that explored factors influencing women's decision making following a prenatal diagnosis of DS. Studies that did not specify DS, unpublished manuscripts, review articles, and book chapters were excluded. Results: A total of 11 studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. The decision to undergo an induced abortion varied depending on whether participants were prospective parents recruited from the general population (23\%-33\% would terminate), pregnant women at increased risk for having a child with DS (46\%-86\% would terminate), or women who received a positive diagnosis of DS during the prenatal period (89\%-97\% terminated). Multiple factors influence women's decision making following a diagnosis of DS, including demographic factors such as religion, maternal age, gestational age, number of existing children, and history of induced abortion. Psychosocial factors including perceived parenting burden/reward, quality of life for a child with DS, attitudes toward and comfort with individuals with disabilities, and support from others also are important influences. Discussion: Multiple factors influence the decisions pregnant women make following the diagnosis of fetal DS. Therefore, it is critical that health care providers who work with pregnant women are aware of these factors.},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We summarize current understanding of scoping review publication rates, terms, definitions, and methods. We propose three recommendations for clarity in term, definition and methodology. RESULTS: We recommend adopting the terms "scoping review" or "scoping study" and the use of a proposed definition. Until such time as further guidance is developed, we recommend the use of the methodological steps outlined in the Arksey and O'Malley framework and further enhanced by Levac et al. The development of reporting guidance for the conduct and reporting of scoping reviews is underway. CONCLUSION: Consistency in the proposed domains and methodologies of scoping reviews, along with the development of reporting guidance, will facilitate methodological advancement, reduce confusion, facilitate collaboration and improve knowledge translation of scoping review findings.},

Current methods used in clinical practice include shotgun massively parallel sequencing (s-MPS); targeted (t-MPS); and an approach that takes advantage of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences between mother and fetus. Efficacy of cfDNA testing for the common autosomal trisomies far exceeds that of conventional screening. Depending on the methodology used, reasons for discordancy between cfDNA results and fetal karyotype can include true fetal mosaicism, confined placental mosaicism, presence of a maternal karyotype abnormality, insufficient counting due to low fetal fraction, and a vanishing twin. Among the possible cfDNA strategies a Primary test has the highest performance but is expensive, while a Contingent cfDNA test can achieve high performance at a relatively low cost. Practicalities to be considered in the provision of testing include pretest counseling about the scope and accuracy of the testing, the interpretation of results when there is a low fetal fraction and follow-up studies for positive test results. The role of first trimester nuchal translucency measurement and conventional biochemical testing needs to be reassessed in the context of the use of cfDNA.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the principal factors contributing to the cost of avoiding a birth with Down syndrome by using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to replace conventional screening. METHODS: A range of unit costs were assigned to each item in the screening process. Detection rates were estimated by meta-analysis and modeling. The marginal cost associated with the detection of additional cases using cfDNA was estimated from the difference in average costs divided by the difference in detection. RESULTS: The main factor was the unit cost of cfDNA testing. For example, replacing a combined test costing \$150 with 3\% false-positive rate and invasive testing at \$1000, by cfDNA tests at \$2000, \$1500, \$1000, and \$500, the marginal cost is \$8.0, \$5.8, \$3.6, and \$1.4m, respectively. Costs were lower when replacing a quadruple test and higher for a 5\% false-positive rate, but the relative importance of cfDNA unit cost was unchanged. A contingent policy whereby 10\% to 20\% women were selected for cfDNA testing by conventional screening was considerably more cost-efficient. Costs were sensitive to cfDNA uptake. CONCLUSION: Universal cfDNA screening for Down syndrome will only become affordable by public health purchasers if costs fall substantially. Until this happens, the contingent use of cfDNA is recommended.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND {$A$}lpha ({$\alpha$})-thalassemia is a global health concern, and improving screening methods is crucial for disease prevention. This study aimed to assess {$\alpha$}-thalassemia genotypes and evaluate the effectiveness of various thresholds for mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) in prenatal screening for {$\alpha$}-thalassemia. METHODS This cross-sectional study included pregnant women and their husbands who underwent prenatal screening for thalassemia at the National Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Vietnam from January 2012 to August 2021. Blood samples were collected and analyzed using the strip assay technique, which can detect 21 common mutations in the {$\alpha$}-globin gene and 22 common mutations in the beta-globin gene. RESULTS Of the 12,030 participants, 931 were identified as having {$\alpha$}-thalassemia, with --SEA, -{$\alpha$}3.7, and -{$\alpha$}4.2~being the most common mutations. When examining different thresholds of MCV and MCH, MCV {$<$}85 fL and MCH {$<$}28 pg had a lower missing rate than MCV {$<$}80 fL and MCH {$<$}27 pg, respectively. MCH {$<$}28 pg showed the highest sensitivity in screening for {$\alpha$}-thalassemia. MCV {$<$}85 fL showed the lowest positive predictive value (PPV). The combination of MCV {$<$}80 fL and MCH {$<$}27 pg showed the lowest sensitivity in screening for {$\alpha$}-thalassemia but the highest PPV among all thresholds. CONCLUSIONS Optimizing the screening methods for {$\alpha$}-thalassemia is important for preventing and managing the disease in the community. These findings have important implications for thalassemia prevention and management programs and may contribute to reducing the burden of thalassemia in the global population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Birth defects are a global public health problem because of their large contribution to infant mortalities and disabilities. It is estimated that 4\%-6\% of Chinese newborns are affected by birth defects every year. Surveillance is a basic approach to understanding the occurrence and associated factors of birth defects. The Ministry of Health of China initiated a national hospital-based birth defects monitoring system 20 years ago. Nearly every province in this country has established its own surveillance system in the past. The authors reviewed the result of the monitoring system at different administrative levels in China. DATA SOURCES: Available publications on the surveillance of birth defects and data from national and provincial birth defects surveillance systems were reviewed to evaluate the effectiveness of the surveillance systems. RESULTS: According to the 2009 data, the national hospital-based birth defects surveillance system monitored over 1.3 million births, which accounted for more than 8\% of births in China. In addition, 30 provincial hospital-based surveillance programs covered a birth population of more than 3.6 million (22\% of births in China). Great achievements have been made in terms of case ascertainment, data quality control, and online reporting. But the surveillance systems in China still have some limitations. A short ascertainment period may miss some internal anomalies, inherited metabolic diseases, and malformed fetus aborted before the 28th gestational week. Discrepancies in antenatal or postnatal diagnosis of birth defects between surveillance institutes may affect the detection rate and introduce biases. Absence of baseline data and lack of integrated database systems limit the application of surveillance data to etiological studies and affect the process of decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: The surveillance system for birth defects is prerequisite to propose, conduct and assess any interventions for the disease. To meet the need of study and prevention of birth defects, measures should be taken to improve the national and provincial birth defects surveillance systems in China.},

  abstract = {Objective: To determine whether it is possible to ``end an HIV epidemic'' among PWID in a low/middle income country. Design: Serial cross-sectional surveys with a cohort of HIV seronegative participants with 6-month follow-up visits recruited from surveys. Methods: Surveys of PWID using respondent driven and snowball sampling were conducted in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 (Ns = 1383, 1451, 1444 and 1268). HIV recency testing was used to identify possible seroconversions in the window period prior to study entry. Structured interviews covering drug use histories, current drug use, and use of HIV-related services were administered by trained interviewers. Urinalysis was used to confirm current drug use. HIV and HCV testing were conducted. Electronic fingerprint readers were used to avoid multiple participation in each survey and to link participants across surveys. A cohort of HIV seronegative participants with 6-month follow-up visits was recruited from the surveys, 480 from 2016, 233 from 2017, and 213 from 2018. Results: Participants were predominantly male (95\%), mean age approximately 40, all reported injecting heroin, HIV prevalence ranged between 26\% - 30\%. We had 3 seroconversions in 1483-person years at risk (PYAR) in the cohort study, and 0 in 696 PYAR among repeat survey participants, and 0 seroconversions in 1344 PYAR in the recency testing. Overall HIV incidence was 0.085/100 PYAR, 95\% CI 0.02 - 0.25/100 PYAR. Conclusion: The data from Hai Phong clearly demonstrate that it is possible to achieve very low HIV incidence---``end an HIV epidemic''--among PWID in a middle-income country.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To examine the prospects for "ending the HIV epidemic" among persons who inject drugs (PWID) in Haiphong, Vietnam. Reaching an incidence of {$<$}0.5/100 person-years at risk (PY) was used as an operational definition for "ending the epidemic." METHODS: A respondent driven sampling study of 603 PWID was conducted from September to October 2014. Current heroin use (verified with urine testing and marks of injection) was an eligibility requirement. A structured questionnaire was administered by trained interviewers to obtain demographic, drug use, and risk behavior data; HIV counseling and testing and HCV testing was also conducted. Two methods (by assuming all new injectors were HIV negative at first injection and by slope of prevalence by years injecting) were used for estimating HIV among persons injecting for {$<$}5 years ("new injectors"). Comparisons were made to the HIV epidemic among PWID in New York City and modeling of the HIV epidemic in Can Tho province. RESULTS: HIV prevalence was 25\% in 2014, down from 68\% in 2006 and 48\% in 2009; overall HCV prevalence in the study was 67\%. Among HIV seropositive PWID, 33\% reported receiving antiretroviral treatment. The great majority (83\%) of subjects reported pharmacies as their primary source of needles and syringes and self-reported receptive and distributive syringe sharing were quite low ({$<$}6\%). Estimating HIV incidence among non-MSM male new injectors with the assumption that all were HIV negative at first injection gave a rate of 1.2/100 person-years (95\% CI -0.24, 3.4). Estimating HIV incidence by the slope of prevalence by years injecting gave a rate of 0.8/100 person-years at risk (95\% CI -0.9, 2.5). CONCLUSIONS: The current HIV epidemic among PWID in Haiphong is in a declining phase, but estimated incidence among non-MSM new injectors is approximately 1/100 person-years and there is a substantial gap in provision of ART for HIV seropositives. Scaling up interventions, particularly HIV counseling and testing and antiretroviral treatment for all seropositive PWID, should accelerate the decline. Ending the epidemic is an attainable public health goal.},

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze data of patients requiring high-dose methadone ({$>$}100 mg/d) as well as associated factors. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed charts of treated patients with high-dose methadone followed in the maintenance methadone treatment center between 01/01/07 and 01/07/10. The following variables (medical history, psychiatric comorbidities, associated drugs, and polyaddictions), were assessed with high-dose methadone, using an univariate and then a multavariate analysis. The threshold value of 130 mg/day (median of maximal daily dose) was used to perform analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, 78 patients, mainly men (75.6\%), with a median age of 34 years [22-57] were included. The both groups with posology of methadone {$\leq$} 130 mg/d (n=44) versus posology of methadone {$>$}130 mg/d (n=34) were close in term of demographic characteristics, consumption of drugs and associated treatments. Plasma methadone concentrations were higher in patients with the daily doses of methadone superior than 130 mg/d (NS), as well as the methadone metabolite (EDDP, p=0.048). Among studied factors, the presence of psychiatric comorbidities was significantly associated with high-dose methadone (threshold 130 mg/d) [OR 4,6 IC 95\% (1.412;14.925)]. Seven patients presented with complications related to methadone: cardiac disorder (3), libido troubles (3) and hypofertility (1). CONCLUSION: Patients requiring high-dose methadone are polydrug addicts. In our study, patients with psychiatric comorbidities needed daily dose of methadone significantly more raised.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The seasonality of cholera is described in various study areas throughout the world. However, no study examines how temporal cycles of the disease vary around the world or reviews its hypothesized causes. This paper reviews the literature on the seasonality of cholera and describes its temporal cycles by compiling and analyzing 32 years of global cholera data. This paper also provides a detailed literature review on regional patterns and environmental and climatic drivers of cholera patterns. DATA, METHODS, AND RESULTS: Cholera data are compiled from 1974 to 2005 from the World Health Organization Weekly Epidemiological Reports, a database that includes all reported cholera cases in 140 countries. The data are analyzed to measure whether season, latitude, and their interaction are significantly associated with the country-level number of outbreaks in each of the 12 preceding months using separate negative binomial regression models for northern, southern, and combined hemispheres. Likelihood ratios tests are used to determine the model of best fit. The results suggest that cholera outbreaks demonstrate seasonal patterns in higher absolute latitudes, but closer to the equator, cholera outbreaks do not follow a clear seasonal pattern. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that environmental and climatic factors partially control the temporal variability of cholera. These results also indirectly contribute to the growing debate about the effects of climate change and global warming. As climate change threatens to increase global temperature, resulting rises in sea levels and temperatures may influence the temporal fluctuations of cholera, potentially increasing the frequency and duration of cholera outbreaks.},

The statistical association between Down syndrome incidence and maternal age, paternal age and birth order has been studied in a sample of over 4000 cases. The size of this sample made it possible to control for the effect of maternal age by single years of age during the search for a paternal age effect and vice versa, and the importance of such stringent control is emphasized. The maternal age association was confirmed with an extremely high degree of statistical significance while no independent effect of paternal age was found; indeed, the rates at paternal ages over 45 years appear to be nearly constant. After adjusting for the effects of parental age, a significant inverse association of birth order with incidence was noted. It also appears that the incidence among very young mothers may be high: for maternal ages 15 years and less the rates seem to be equivalent to those found at 30 or 35 years. In order to help answer the question of whether the maternal age association is the result of increasing rates of nondisjunction or of some other mechanism (for example, an age related defect in a spontaneous abortion screening mechanism), the proportion of cases due to maternal and paternal nondisjunction at different parental ages must be determined.},

The aim of this French population-based study was to assess whether a similar benefit could be obtained in countries characterized by high performances in the diagnosis and management of CRC. Methods: Small-sized geographic areas, including 91,199 individuals aged 45--74 years, were allocated to either FOBT screening or no screening. Six screening rounds were performed. The FOBT was performed without diet restriction and was sent to a central analysis center and processed without rehydration. Screening group participants who had a positive test result were offered a full colonoscopy. The entire population was followed up for 11 years after study entry. Results: Acceptability of the test was 52.8\% at the first screening round and varied between 53.8\% and 58.3\% in the successive rounds. Positivity rates were 2.1\% initially and 1.4\% on average in the successive rounds. CRC mortality was significantly lower in the screening population compared with the control population (mortality ratio, 0.84; 95\% confidence interval, 0.71--0.99). The reduction in CRC mortality was more pronounced in those who participated at least once (mortality ratio, 0.67; 95\% confidence interval, 0.56--0.81). Conclusions: Our findings, together with the results of other trials, suggest that biennial screening by FOBTs can reduce CRC mortality regardless of the quality of the health system and support attempts to introduce large-scale screening programs into the general population.},

Here, we define and experimentally test an offline man/machine interface that takes advantage of the discharge timings of spinal motor neurons. The motor-neuron behaviour is identified by deconvolution of the electrical activity of muscles reinnervated by nerves of a missing limb in patients with amputation at the shoulder or humeral level. We mapped the series of motor-neuron discharges into control commands across multiple degrees of freedom via the offline application of direct proportional control, pattern recognition and musculoskeletal modelling. A series of experiments performed on six patients reveal that the man/machine interface has superior offline performance compared with conventional direct electromyographic control applied after targeted muscle innervation. The combination of surgical procedures, decoding and mapping into effective commands constitutes an interface with the output layers of the spinal cord circuitry that allows for the intuitive control of multiple degrees of freedom.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human Down syndrome (DS) is usually caused by genomic micro-duplications and dosage imbalances of human chromosome 21. It is associated with many genomic and phenotype abnormalities. Even though human DS occurs about 1 per 1,000 births worldwide, which is a very high rate, researchers haven't found any effective method to cure DS. Currently, the most efficient ways of human DS prevention are screening and early detection. METHODS: In this study, we used deep learning techniques and analyzed a set of Illumina genotyping array data. We built a bi-stream convolutional neural networks model to screen/predict the occurrence of DS. Firstly, we built image input data by converting the intensities of each SNP site into chromosome SNP maps. Next, we proposed a bi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with nine layers and two branch models. We further merged two CNN branch models into one model in the fourth convolutional layer, and output the prediction in the last layer. RESULTS: Our bi-stream CNN model achieved 99.3\% average accuracies, and very low false-positive and false-negative rates, which was necessary for further applications in disease prediction and medical practice. We further visualized the feature maps and learned filters from intermediate convolutional layers, which showed the genomic patterns and correlated SNPs variations in human DS genomes. We also compared our methods with other CNN and traditional machine learning models. We further analyzed and discussed the characteristics and strengths of our bi-stream CNN model. CONCLUSIONS: Our bi-stream model used two branch CNN models to learn the local genome features and regional patterns among adjacent genes and SNP sites from two chromosomes simultaneously. It achieved the best performance in all evaluating metrics when compared with two single-stream CNN models and three traditional machine-learning algorithms. The visualized feature maps also provided opportunities to study the genomic markers and pathway components associated with Human DS, which provided insights for gene therapy and genomic medicine developments.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: 100 years after the first description, Alzheimer's disease is one of the most disabling and burdensome health conditions worldwide. We used the Delphi consensus method to determine dementia prevalence for each world region. METHODS: 12 international experts were provided with a systematic review of published studies on dementia and were asked to provide prevalence estimates for every WHO world region, for men and women combined, in 5-year age bands from 60 to 84 years, and for those aged 85 years and older. UN population estimates and projections were used to estimate numbers of people with dementia in 2001, 2020, and 2040. We estimated incidence rates from prevalence, remission, and mortality. FINDINGS: Evidence from well-planned, representative epidemiological surveys is scarce in many regions. We estimate that 24.3 million people have dementia today, with 4.6 million new cases of dementia every year (one new case every 7 seconds). The number of people affected will double every 20 years to 81.1 million by 2040. Most people with dementia live in developing countries (60\% in 2001, rising to 71\% by 2040). Rates of increase are not uniform; numbers in developed countries are forecast to increase by 100\% between 2001 and 2040, but by more than 300\% in India, China, and their south Asian and western Pacific neighbours. INTERPRETATION: We believe that the detailed estimates in this paper constitute the best currently available basis for policymaking, planning, and allocation of health and welfare resources.},

  abstract = {In 10 years, Google Translate has gone from supporting just a few languages to 103, connecting strangers, reaching across language barriers and even helping people find love. At the start, we pioneered large-scale statistical machine translation, which uses statistical models to translate text. Today, we're introducing the next step in making Google Translate even better: Neural Machine Translation. Neural Machine Translation has been generating exciting research results for a few years and in September, our researchers announced Google's version of this technique. At a high level, the Neural system translates whole sentences at a time, rather than just piece by piece. It uses this broader context to help it figure out the most relevant translation, which it then rearranges and adjusts to be more like a human speaking with proper grammar. Since it's easier to understand each sentence, translated paragraphs and articles are a lot smoother and easier to read. And this is all possible because of end-to-end learning system built on Neural Machine Translation, which basically means that the system learns over time to create better, more natural translations. Today we're putting Neural Machine Translation into action with a total of eight language pairs to and from English and French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. These represent the native languages of around one-third of the world's population, covering more than 35\% of all Google Translate queries!},

The abnormal genes in different combinations lead to over 60 different thalassaemia syndromes, making Southeast Asia the locality with the most complex thalassaemia genotypes. The four major thalassaemic diseases are Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis (homozygous {$\alpha$}-thalassaemia 1), homozygous {$\beta$}-thalassaemia, {$\beta$}-thalassaemia/Hb E and Hb H diseases. {$\alpha$}-Thalassaemia, most often, occurs from gene deletions whereas point mutations and small deletions or insertions in the {$\beta$}-globin gene sequence are the major molecular defects responsible for most {$\beta$}-thalassaemias. Clinical manifestations of {$\alpha$}-thalassaemia range from asymptomatic cases with normal findings to the totally lethal Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis syndrome. Homozygosity of {$\beta$}-thalassaemia results in a severe thalassaemic disease while the patients with compound heterozygosity, {$\beta$}-thalassaemia/Hb E, present variable severity of anaemia, and some can be as severe as homozygous {$\beta$}-thalassaemia. Concomitant inheritance of {$\alpha$}-thalassaemia and increased production of Hb F are responsible for mild clinical phenotypes in some patients. However, there are still some unknown factors that can modulate disease severity in both {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-thalassaemias. Therefore, it is possible to set a strategy for prevention and control of thalassaemia, which includes population screening for heterozygotes, genetic counselling and foetal diagnosis with selective abortion of affected pregnancies.},

This paper describes the adaptation of four evidence-based interventions (EBI) (motivational interviewing, contingency management, Matrix group model and SMS text messaging) for treating methamphetamine use among POUD receiving methadone maintenance therapy in Vietnam. METHODS: Following the ADAPT-ITT (Assessment-Decision-Administration-Production-Topical experts-Training-Testing) framework, we conducted 16 focus group discussions with POUD (n\,=\,25) and providers (n\,=\,22) at four methadone clinics in two largest cities (Hanoi in the North, Ho Chi Minh City in the South) to assess patterns of methamphetamine use and to get feedback on proposed EBIs. The proposed EBIs were properly adapted and used to train providers in two of the four methadone clinics. The revised EBIs were tested over 12\,weeks among 42 POUD on methadone who use methamphetamine. Post-intervention feedback served to fine-tune the revised EBIs. RESULTS: Insights about patterns of methamphetamine use suggested that EBIs should focus on different triggers to methamphetamine use among POUD receiving methadone treatment in the two cities. All EBIs should emphasise family-related topics to build a strong motivation for treatment. Participants suggested when, where and how each EBI should be delivered. Most participants were satisfied with the adapted EBIs. Limited human resources at methadone clinics might hinder implementation of the adapted EBIs. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: We successfully completed the adaptation of EBIs for POUD who use methamphetamine on methadone in Vietnam. The pilot testing of the adapted EBIs demonstrated feasibility and acceptability. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04706624. Registered 13 January 2021. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04706624.},

  abstract = {Rationale Congenital heart disease (CHD) is among the most common birth defects. Most cases are of unknown etiology. Objective To determine the contribution of de novo copy number variants (CNVs) in the etiology of sporadic CHD. Methods and Results We studied 538 CHD trios using genome-wide dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and/or whole exome sequencing (WES). Results were experimentally validated using digital droplet PCR. We compared validated CNVs in CHD cases to CNVs in 1,301 healthy control trios. The two complementary high-resolution technologies identified 63 validated de novo CNVs in 51 CHD cases. A significant increase in CNV burden was observed when comparing CHD trios with healthy trios, using either SNP array (p=7x10-5, Odds Ratio (OR)=4.6) or WES data (p=6x10-4, OR=3.5) and remained after removing 16\% of de novo CNV loci previously reported as pathogenic (p=0.02, OR=2.7). We observed recurrent de novo CNVs on 15q11.2 encompassing CYFIP1, NIPA1, and NIPA2 and single de novo CNVs encompassing DUSP1, JUN, JUP, MED15, MED9, PTPRE SREBF1, TOP2A, and ZEB2, genes that interact with established CHD proteins NKX2-5 and GATA4. Integrating de novo variants in WES and CNV data suggests that ETS1 is the pathogenic gene altered by 11q24.2-q25 deletions in Jacobsen syndrome and that CTBP2 is the pathogenic gene in 10q sub-telomeric deletions. Conclusions We demonstrate a significantly increased frequency of rare de novo CNVs in CHD patients compared with healthy controls and suggest several novel genetic loci for CHD.},

While clinical outcomes have been well documented, there has been a paucity of literature describing postnatal imaging findings in long-term survivors. We present a case report of a 2-year-old girl with trisomy 13 who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging examination at our institution to evaluate for possible structural abnormalities contributing to central sleep apnea. We describe the clinical and postnatal neuroimaging findings of this rare patient with trisomy 13. Understanding the spectrum of neuroradiological findings in long-term survivors with trisomy 13, in combination with other organ system abnormalities, could add important clinical information and help better predict patient outcomes and expectations among parents.},

Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to provide an update from year 2010 to 2020 on the prevalence of \&alpha;-thalassemia in Southeast Asia. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed and SCOPUS databases for related studies published from 2010 to 2020, based on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Heterogeneity of included studies was examined with the I2 index and Q-test. Funnel plots and Egger\&rsquo;s tests were performed in order to determine publication bias in this meta-analysis. Twenty-nine studies with 83,674 subjects were included and pooled prevalence rates in this meta-analysis were calculated using random effect models based on high observed heterogeneity (I2 \&gt; 99.5, p-value \&lt; 0.1). Overall, the prevalence of \&alpha;-thalassemia is 22.6\%. The highest \&alpha;-thalassemia prevalence was observed in Vietnam (51.5\%) followed by Cambodia (39.5\%), Laos (26.8\%), Thailand (20.1\%), and Malaysia (17.3\%). No publication bias was detected. Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggested that a high prevalence of \&alpha;-thalassemia occurred in selected Southeast Asia countries.

  abstract = {Alpha({$\alpha$})-thalassemia is a blood disorder caused by many types of inheritable {$\alpha$}-globin gene mutations which causes no-to-severe clinical symptoms, such as Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis that leads to early foetal death. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to provide an update from year 2010 to 2020 on the prevalence of {$\alpha$}-thalassemia in Southeast Asia. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed and SCOPUS databases for related studies published from 2010 to 2020, based on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Heterogeneity of included studies was examined with the I2 index and Q-test. Funnel plots and Egger's tests were performed in order to determine publication bias in this meta-analysis. Twenty-nine studies with 83,674 subjects were included and pooled prevalence rates in this meta-analysis were calculated using random effect models based on high observed heterogeneity (I2 {$>$} 99.5, p-value {$<$} 0.1). Overall, the prevalence of {$\alpha$}-thalassemia is 22.6\%. The highest {$\alpha$}-thalassemia prevalence was observed in Vietnam (51.5\%) followed by Cambodia (39.5\%), Laos (26.8\%), Thailand (20.1\%), and Malaysia (17.3\%). No publication bias was detected. Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggested that a high prevalence of {$\alpha$}-thalassemia occurred in selected Southeast Asia countries. This meta-analysis data are useful for designing thalassemia screening programs and improve the disease management.},

  abstract = {Fetal congenital heart disease (FHD) is a common and serious congenital malformation in children. In Asia, FHD birth defect rates have reached as high as 9.3\%. For the early detection of birth defects and mortality, echocardiography remains the most effective method for screening fetal heart malformations. However, standard echocardiograms of the fetal heart, especially four-chamber view images, are difficult to obtain. In addition, the pathophysiological changes in fetal hearts during different pregnancy periods lead to ever-changing two-dimensional fetal heart structures and hemodynamics, and it requires extensive professional knowledge to recognize and judge disease development. Thus, research on the automatic screening for FHD is necessary. In this paper, we proposed a new model named DGACNN that shows the best performance in recognizing FHD, achieving a rate of 85\%. The motivation for this network is to deal with the problem that there are insufficient training datasets to train a robust model. There are many unlabeled video slices, but they are tough and time-consuming to annotate. Thus, how to use these un-annotated video slices to improve the DGACNN capability for recognizing FHD, in terms of both recognition accuracy and robustness, is very meaningful for FHD screening. The architecture of DGACNN comprises two parts, that is, DANomaly and GACNN (Wgan-GP and CNN). DANomaly, similar to the ALOCC network, but incorporates cycle adversarial learning to train an end-to-end one-class classification (OCC) network that is more robust and has a higher accuracy than ALOCC in screening video slices. For the GACNN architecture, we use FCH (four chamber heart) video slices at around the end-systole, as screened by DANomaly, to train a WGAN-GP for the purpose of obtaining ideal low-level features that can robustly improve the FHD recognition accuracy. A few annotated video slices, as screened by DANomaly, can also be used for data augmentation so as to improve the FHD recognition further. The experiments show that the DGACNN outperforms other state-of-the-art networks by 1\%-20\% in recognizing FHD. A comparison experiment shows that the proposed network already outperforms the performance of expert cardiologists in recognizing FHD, reaching 84\% in a test. Thus, the proposed architecture has high potential for helping cardiologists complete early FHD screenings.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of the Eurofetus Study was to evaluate the accuracy of the antenatal detection of malformations by routine ultrasonographic examination in unselected populations. Study Design: All ultrasonographic diagnoses of malformations and the outcomes of the fetuses were prospectively recorded in 61 European obstetric units over a 3-year period (1990-1993). Also recorded were all cases of malformation diagnosed after abortion or birth for the mothers who underwent follow-up in these centers. Results: Of 3685 malformed fetuses, 2262 had received diagnoses during pregnancy (sensitivity, 61.4\%). Of a total number of 4615 malformations, 2593 were detected (sensitivity, 56.2\%). The detection sensitivity was higher for the major than for the minor abnormalities (73.7\% vs 45.7\%), and the diagnosis was made earlier in the pregnancy (24.2 weeks vs 27.6, P {$<$} .01). Overall, 55\% of the major abnormalities were detected within 24 gestational weeks. Within each severity group the accuracy of detection depended on the system. For the major abnormalities it was better for the central nervous system (88.3\%) and urinary tract (84.8\%) but lower for the heart and great vessels (38.8\%). Detection of minor abnormalities was also effective for the urinary tract (89.1\%) but not for the heart and great vessels (20.8\%) or the musculoskeletal system (18\%). Detection of abnormalities had an influence on the rate of termination of pregnancy. The rate of live births for the mothers bearing fetuses with major abnormalities was lower than that for the mothers in whom no abnormalities were detected, mainly because of the higher rate of elective terminations of pregnancy in the former group. Conclusion: Systematic ultrasonographic screening during pregnancy can now detect a large proportion of fetal malformations, although some still escape detection.

  abstract = {Deep learning is a family of computational methods that allow an algorithm to program itself by learning from a large set of examples that demonstrate the desired behavior, removing the need to specify rules explicitly. Application of these methods to medical imaging requires further assessment and validation.To apply deep learning to create an algorithm for automated detection of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema in retinal fundus photographs.A specific type of neural network optimized for image classification called a deep convolutional neural network was trained using a retrospective development data set of 128\,175 retinal images, which were graded 3 to 7 times for diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and image gradability by a panel of 54 US licensed ophthalmologists and ophthalmology senior residents between May and December 2015. The resultant algorithm was validated in January and February 2016 using 2 separate data sets, both graded by at least 7 US board-certified ophthalmologists with high intragrader consistency.Deep learning--trained algorithm.The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR), defined as moderate and worse diabetic retinopathy, referable diabetic macular edema, or both, were generated based on the reference standard of the majority decision of the ophthalmologist panel. The algorithm was evaluated at 2 operating points selected from the development set, one selected for high specificity and another for high sensitivity.The EyePACS-1 data set consisted of 9963 images from 4997 patients (mean age, 54.4 years; 62.2\% women; prevalence of RDR, 683/8878 fully gradable images [7.8\%]); the Messidor-2 data set had 1748 images from 874 patients (mean age, 57.6 years; 42.6\% women; prevalence of RDR, 254/1745 fully gradable images [14.6\%]). For detecting RDR, the algorithm had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.991 (95\% CI, 0.988-0.993) for EyePACS-1 and 0.990 (95\% CI, 0.986-0.995) for Messidor-2. Using the first operating cut point with high specificity, for EyePACS-1, the sensitivity was 90.3\% (95\% CI, 87.5\%-92.7\%) and the specificity was 98.1\% (95\% CI, 97.8\%-98.5\%). For Messidor-2, the sensitivity was 87.0\% (95\% CI, 81.1\%-91.0\%) and the specificity was 98.5\% (95\% CI, 97.7\%-99.1\%). Using a second operating point with high sensitivity in the development set, for EyePACS-1 the sensitivity was 97.5\% and specificity was 93.4\% and for Messidor-2 the sensitivity was 96.1\% and specificity was 93.9\%.In this evaluation of retinal fundus photographs from adults with diabetes, an algorithm based on deep machine learning had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy. Further research is necessary to determine the feasibility of applying this algorithm in the clinical setting and to determine whether use of the algorithm could lead to improved care and outcomes compared with current ophthalmologic assessment.},

  abstract = {Background Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is highly effective for reducing heroin use and HIV transmission among people who inject opioids. We sought to measure and understand factors associated with continued heroin use, a critical outcome among MMT patients in Vietnam. Method We abstracted data from medical charts of nationally representative sample of patients who were on MMT during May 2008--December 2013, selecting 10 MMT clinics using probability proportional to size and 50 patients/clinic by systematic random sampling. Concurrent heroin use was defined by self-report/positive urine test recorded in patient charts during month 3, 6, 12, and 24 after MMT initiation. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with concurrent heroin use over the first 24 months in treatment. Results All clients used heroin at baseline; concurrent heroin use was 55\% at month 3; 19\%, 14.6\% and 15.2\% at month 6, 12, and 24, respectively. Having no baseline family emotional/financial support versus having (AOR=2.03; 95\% confidence interval [CI]=1.17--3.53); using heroin for {$<$}15 years versus {$\geq$}15 years at baseline (AOR=1.55; 95\%CI=1.01--2.38); being HIV-infected/not on antiretroviral treatment (ART; AOR=1.79; 95\% CI=1.07--2.98) or being HIV infected/on ART (AOR=2.39; 95\% CI=1.61--3.55), versus not being HIV infected; baseline methamphetamine using versus non-using (AOR=2.68; 95\%CI=1.08--6.65), were associated with increased odds of concurrent heroin use among patients. Conclusion The association between concurrent heroin use among MMT patients with the lack of family emotional/financial support recommends garnering family support is critical. Association with shorter heroin use history suggests motivational enhancement may reduce concurrent heroin use. Living with HIV, whether or not on ART, associated with increased concurrent heroin use suggests safe injection commodities and education, and drug-drug interaction management, are needed for this subgroup. Though few MMT clients reported baseline methamphetamine use, its association with later heroin use suggests the need for effective methamphetamine use interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As a dual response to the HIV epidemic and the high level of injecting drug use in Vietnam, the Ministry of Health (MOH) initiated a pilot methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) program in Hai Phong and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) in early 2009. The objectives of the pilot were to provide evidence on whether MMT could be successfully implemented in Vietnam and scaled up to other localities. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted among 965 opiate drug users admitted to the pilot. Data on demographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, substance use behaviors (including heroin use), and blood-borne virus infection (HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C) were collected at treatment initiation and then again at 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month intervals thereafter. RESULTS: Twenty-four months after treatment initiation, heroin use as measured by urine test or self-report had reduced from 100~\% of participants at both sites to 14.6~\% in Hai Phong and 22.9~\% in HCMC. When adjusted for multiple factors in Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) logistic regression modeling, independent predictors of continued heroin use after 24~months of MMT in HCMC were the following: poor methadone adherence (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)\,=\,3.7, 95~\% confidence interval (CI) 1.8-7.8); currently on antiretroviral treatment (ART) (AOR\,=\,1.8, 95~\% CI 1.4-2.4); currently on TB treatment (AOR\,=\,2.2, 95~\% CI 1.4-3.4); currently experiencing family conflict (AOR\,=\,1.6, 95~\% CI 1.1-2.4); and currently employed (AOR\,=\,0.8, 95~\% CI 0.6-1.0). For Hai Phong participants, predictors were the following: currently on ART (AOR\,=\,2.0, 95~\% CI\,=\,1.4-3.0); currently experiencing family conflict (AOR\,=\,2.0, 95~\% CI\,=\,1.0-3.9); and moderate adherence to methadone (AOR\,=\,2.1, 95~\% CI\,=\,1.2-1.9). In Hai Phong, the percentage of participants who were employed had also increased by end of study from 35.0 to 52.8~\%, while in HCMC the level remained relatively unchanged, between 52.2 and 55.1~\%. DISCUSSION: Study findings were used in multiple fora to convince policymakers and the public on the significant and vital role MMT can play in reducing heroin use and improving quality of life for individuals and families. Four years after this study was completed, Vietnam had expanded MMT to 162 clinics in 44 provinces serving 32,000 patients.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Various factors are driving interest in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) for breast cancer (BC) detection, but it is unclear whether the evidence warrants large-scale use in population-based screening.Areas covered: We performed a scoping review, a structured evidence synthesis describing a broad research field, to summarize knowledge on AI evaluated for BC detection and to assess AI's readiness for adoption in BC screening. Studies were predominantly small retrospective studies based on highly selected image datasets that contained a high proportion of cancers (median BC proportion in datasets 26.5\%), and used heterogeneous techniques to develop AI models; the range of estimated AUC (area under ROC curve) for AI models was 69.2--97.8\% (median AUC 88.2\%). We identified various methodologic limitations including use of non-representative imaging data for model training, limited validation in external datasets, potential bias in training data, and few comparative data for AI versus radiologists' interpretation of mammography screening.Expert opinion: Although contemporary AI models have reported generally good accuracy for BC detection, methodological concerns, and evidence gaps exist that limit translation into clinical BC screening settings. These should be addressed in parallel to advancing AI techniques to render AI transferable to large-scale population-based screening.},

Most episodes reflected high use and incarceration, however these events occurred more frequently among heroin and meth users. Quitting was predicted by current treatment and self-help participation among meth (RR 2.57, 1.79--3.70; 2.57, 1.80--3.67) and cocaine (RR 2.00, 1.42--2.81; 2.10, 1.63--2.72) users, and by a history of quitting for meth users (RR 1.11, 1.06--1.17). Quitting was less likely among all users under legal supervision (RR 0.55--0.69) and among heroin (RR 0.66, 0.45--0.97) and meth users (RR 0.73, 0.60--0.89) with an early drug-use onset. Relative to cocaine or meth use, heroin use was characterized by persistent use at a high-level which was often only interrupted by incarceration. While quitting drug use can be facilitated by treatment and/or self-help participation, few people had these experiences in the 10 years following first use.},

METHODS: This descriptive study was conducted from 2000-2001. Stool samples were taken from inpatients or those referred to the laboratory from other hospitals, clinics and general practitioners. Samples were processed and Vibrio cholerae isolates were identified according to standard protocols. Tellurite Taurocholate Gelatin agar was used as a selective medium for Vibrio cholerae. Serogroups were identified by slide agglutination with polyvalent antisera. Antimicrobial sensitivities were performed by Kirby Bauer technique. Data was entered and analyzed using SPSS, p values were calculated using t test and two independent samples test. RESULTS: During the study period, 144 samples were found to be infected with Vibrio cholerae O139 in comparison with 545 Vibrio cholerae O1. Infection with O139 was characteristically observed in the older population (mean age = 40 years) in contrast with Vibrio cholerae O1 strains (mean age = 23 years) (p. value = {$<$}0.001). Sensitivity pattern of 2000-2001 Vibrio cholerae isolates was markedly different to that of 1993-1994. The earlier isolates were resistant to Cotrimoxazole (99\%) and Chloramphenicol (35\%) whereas the recent isolates are almost 100\% sensitive. CONCLUSION: In conclusion this re-emergent strain seen 6 years after previous episode infected large number of people especially older population suggesting that prior infection with O1 does not provide immunity against O139 and therefore Vibrio cholerae O139 has a potential to cause a major epidemic in an immunologically na{\"i}ve population.},

  abstract = {Antenatal screening for beta thalassemia trait (BTT) followed by counseling of couples is an efficient way of thalassemia control. Since high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is costly, other cost-effective screening methods need to be devised for this purpose. The present study was aimed at evaluating the utility of red cell indices and machine learning algorithms including an artificial neural network (ANN) in detection of BTT among antenatal women. This cross-sectional study included all antenatal women undergoing thalassemia screening at a tertiary care hospital. Complete blood count followed by HPLC was performed. Receiver operating characteristic~(ROC)~curve analysis was performed for obtaining optimal cutoff for each of the indices with determination of test characteristics for detection of BTT. Machine learning algorithms including C4.5 and Na{\"i}ve Bayes (NB) classifier and a back-propagation type ANN including the red cell indices was designed and tested. Over a period of 15~months, 3947 patients underwent thalassemia screening. BTT was diagnosed in 5.98\% of women on the basis of HPLC. ROC analysis yielded the maximum accuracy of 63.8\%, sensitivity and specificity of 66.2\% and 63.7\%, respectively for Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). The C4.5 and NB classifier had accuracy of 88.56\%-82.49\% respectively while ANN had an overall accuracy of 85.95\%, sensitivity of 83.81\%, and specificity of 88.10\% in detection of BTT. The present study highlights that none of the red cell parameters standalone is useful for screening for BTT. However, ANN with combination of all the red cell indices had an appreciable sensitivity and specificity for this purpose. Further refinements of the neural network can provide an appropriate tool for use in peripheral settings for thalassemia screening.},

The least squares estimators were studied by Gauss and by other authors later in the nineteenth century. A proof that the best unbiased estimator of a linear function of the means of a set of observed random variables is the least squares estimator was given by Markov [12], a modified version of whose proof is given by David and Neyman [4]. A slightly more general theorem is given by Aitken [1]. Fisher [5] indicated that for large samples the maximum likelihood estimator approximately minimizes the mean squared error when compared with other reasonable estimators. This paper will be concerned with optimum properties or failure of optimum properties of the natural estimator in certain special problems with the risk usually measured by the mean squared error or, in the case of several parameters, by a quadratic function of the estimators. We shall first mention some recent papers on this subject and then give some results, mostly unpublished, in greater detail.},

OBJECTIVE: In this work we propose an integrated genetic-neural network (GNN) to improve the prediction risk of trisomy diseases including Down's syndrome (T21), Edwards' syndrome (T18) and Patau's Syndrome (T13). METHODS: A dataset including 561 pregnant were created. In this integrated model, the structure and input parameters of the proposed multilayer feedforward network (MFN) were optimized. RESULTS: The results of execution of the GNN on the testing dataset showed that the developed model can be accurately classify the anomalies from healthy fetus with 97.58\% accuracy rate, and 99.44\% and 85.65\% sensitivity, and specificity, respectively. In the proposed GNN model, the Levenberg Merquident (LM) algorithm, the Radial Basis (Radbas) function from various types of functions were selected by the proposed GA. Moreover, maternal age, Nuchal Translucency (NT), Crown-rump length (CRL), Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) were selected by the proposed GA as the most effective factors for classifying the healthfetuses from the cases with fetal disorders. CONCLUSION: The proposed computerized model increases the diagnostic performance of the physicians especially in the accurate detection of healthy fetus with non - invasive and low - cost treatments.},

We then review in more details the AI applications in stroke, in the three major areas of early detection and diagnosis, treatment, as well as outcome prediction and prognosis evaluation. We conclude with discussion about pioneer AI systems, such as IBM Watson, and hurdles for real-life deployment of AI.},

Using haplotype and phylogenetic analyses, we examined the origin of this defect in Southeast Asian populations. Study was done on both normal and {$\alpha$}0-thalassemia alleles in 3 ethnic groups including 96 Thai, 52 Laotian and 21 Cambodian. Five SNPs encompassing the (-SEA) including (rs3760053 T{$>$}G), (rs1211375 A{$>$}C), (rs3918352 A{$>$}G), (rs1203974 A{$>$}G) and (rs11248914 C{$>$}T) were examined using high-resolution melting assays. It was found that 94.0\% of Thai, 100\% of Laotian and 100\% of Cambodian {$\alpha$}0-thalassemia alleles were linked to the same haplotype: the haplotype H4 (AAGC), representing an Asian specific origin. An G allele of the (rs3760053) was found to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with the {$\alpha$}0-thalassemia allele in these populations. A multiplex PCR assay was developed to detect simultaneously the (-SEA) allele and genotyping of a linked (rs3760053) to improve accuracy of prenatal diagnosis of {$\alpha$}0-thalassemia. Application of this multiplex PCR assay for routine prenatal diagnosis of {$\alpha$}0-thalassemia in 12 families revealed a 100\% concordant result with conventional gap-PCR assay. Therefore, a single genetic origin is responsible for the spread and high prevalence of the (-SEA) in the region. The multiplex PCR assay developed should provide a double-check PCR system for more accurate diagnosis and allow the monitoring of possible maternal contamination at prenatal diagnosis of this important genetic disorder.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and {$\beta$}-thalassemia trait ({$\beta$}-TT) are the most common types of microcytic hypochromic anemias. The similarity and the nature of anemia-related symptoms pose a foremost challenge for discriminating between IDA and {$\beta$}-TT. Currently, advances in technology have gave rise to computer-based decision-making systems. Therefore, advances in artificial intelligence have led to the emergence of intelligent systems and the development of tools that can assist physicians in the diagnosis and decision-making. AIM: The aim of the present study was to develop a neural network based model (Artificial Neural Network) for accurate and timely manner of differential diagnosis of IDA and {$\beta$}-TT in comparison with traditional methods. METHODS: In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) model as the first precise intelligent method was developed for differential diagnosis of IDA and {$\beta$}-TT. Data set was retrieved from Complete Blood Count (CBC) test factors of 268 individuals referred to Padad private clinical laboratory at Ahvaz, Iran in 2018. ANN models with different topologies were developed and CBC indices were examined for diagnosis of IDA and {$\beta$}-TT. The proposed model was simulated using MATLAB software package version 2018. The results showed the best network architecture based on the advanced multilayer algorithm (4 input factors, 70 neurons with acceptable sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy). Finally, the results obtained from ANN diagnostic model was compared to existing discriminating indexes. RESULT: The results of this model showed that the specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of the proposed diagnostic system were 92.33\%, 93.13\%, and 92.5\%, respectably; i.e. the model could diagnose frequent occurrence of IDA in patients with {$\beta$}-TT. CONCLUSION: The results and evaluation of the developed model showed that the proposed neural network model has a proper accuracy and generalizability based on the initial factors of CBC testing compared to existing methods. This model can replace the high-cost methods and discriminating indices to distinguish IDA from {$\beta$}-TT and assist in accurate and timely manner diagnosis.},

A comparison of the haematological and haemoglobin synthesis findings of individuals with normal alpha genotypes (alpha alpha/alpha alpha) with those with one (-alpha/alpha alpha) or two (-alpha/-alpha) alpha genes deleted shows that the latter two groups have more balanced globin chain synthesis ratios, higher haemoglobin levels, and larger, better haemoglobinized red cells. This suggests that the degree of globin chain imbalance is a significant factor in determining the red cell characteristics in heterozygous beta thalassaemia. Screening programmes for thalassaemia, based on the detection of low MCVs, could miss cases of the interaction of alpha and beta thalassaemia.},

In recent decade, there has been a growing evidence that methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is associated with a significant decrease in both drug- and sex-related risk behaviors among this high-risk population. The better understanding of the relationship between MMT and HIV-related risk behaviors will help to better inform future HIV prevention strategies, which may have policy implications as well. In this systematic review, we therefore aimed to explore the relevant literature to more clearly examine the possible impact of MMT on HIV risks behaviors among high-risk IDUs. The findings thus far suggest that MMT is associated with a significant decrease in injecting drug use and sharing of injecting equipment. Evidence on sex-related risk behavior is limited, but suggest that MMT is associated with a lower incidence of multiple sex partners and unprotected sex. The literature also suggests that the most significant factor in reducing HIV risks was treatment adherence. As such, more attention needs to be given in future studies to ensure the higher rates of access to MMT as well as to improve the adherence to MMT.},

Traditionally, {$\beta$}-thalassemia has been more common in certain regions of the world such as the Mediterranean, Middle East, and Southeast Asia. However, the prevalence of {$\beta$}-thalassemia is increasing in other regions, including Northern Europe and North America, primarily due to migration. This review summarizes the available data on the changing incidence and prevalence of {$\beta$}-thalassemia as well as factors influencing disease frequency. The data suggest that the epidemiology of {$\beta$}-thalassemia is changing: Migration has increased the prevalence of the disease in regions traditionally believed to have a low prevalence, while, at the same time, prevention and screening programs in endemic regions have reduced the number of affected individuals. Various approaches to prevention and screening have been used. Region-specific prevention and treatment programs, customized to align with local healthcare resources and cultural values, have been effective in identifying patients and carriers and providing information and care. Significant challenges remain in universally implementing these programs.},

A series of structural equation models were derived from theory and previous research and were tested on a national sample of students. Results suggest that parent involvement has a large and significant effect on students' grade point average in tenth grade. The pattern of influences of the variables in the model were indistinguishable for boys and girls, suggesting that the same model of influences holds across gender. There were differences in the constructs in the model and in their effects across ethnic groups, however. Nevertheless, parent involvement continued to have important effects for all groups. Thus interventions designed to increase involvement, if successful, should result in increases in learning for all groups.},

Expectant mothers in developing countries may not have access to or may not afford the advanced prenatal screening tests. To solve this issue, this paper explores the practicality of using only the basic risk factors for developing prediction models as a tool for initial risk assessment. The prediction models are based on logistic regression. The results show that the prediction models do not have a high balanced classification rate. However, these models can still be used as an effective tool for initial risk assessment for T-21 and NTDs by eliminating at least 50\% of the cases with no or low risk.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hemoglobinopathies are among the most common inherited diseases around the world. They have become much more common recently in northern and central Europe, including Germany, due to immigration. METHOD: Selective review of the literature with consideration of national guidelines. RESULTS: The hemoglobinopathies encompass all genetic diseases of hemoglobin. They fall into two main groups: thalassemia syndromes and structural hemoglobin variants (abnormal hemoglobins). {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-thalassemia are the main types of thalassemia; the main structural hemoglobin variants are HbS, HbE and HbC. There are many subtypes and combined types in each group. The highly variable clinical manifestations of the hemoglobinopathies range from mild hypochromic anemia to moderate hematological disease to severe, lifelong, transfusion-dependent anemia with multiorgan involvement. Stem-cell transplantation is the preferred treatment for the severe forms of thalassemia. Supportive, rather than curative, treatment consists of periodic blood transfusions for life, combined with iron chelation. Drugs to treat the symptoms of sickle-cell disease include analgesics, antibiotics, ACE inhibitors and hydroxyurea. Blood transfusions should be given only when strictly indicated. More than 90\% of patients currently survive into adulthood. Optimally treated patients have a projected life span of 50 to 60 years. CONCLUSION: Hemoglobinopathies are a public health issue in today's multiethnic German population. Adequate care of the affected patients requires a wide variety of diagnostic and therapeutic measures.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The hypochromic microcytic anemia (HMA) commonly found in Thailand are iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and thalassemia trait (TT). Accurate discrimination between IDA and TT is an important issue and better methods are urgently needed. Although considerable RBC formulas and indices with various optimal cut-off values have been developed, distinguishing between IDA and TT is still a challenging problem due to the diversity of various anemic populations. To address this problem, it is desirable to develop an improved and automated prediction model for discriminating IDA from TT. METHODS: We retrospectively collected laboratory data of HMA found in Thai adults. Five machine learnings, including k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), decision tree, random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM), were applied to construct a discriminant model. Performance was assessed and compared with thirteen existing discriminant formulas and indices. RESULTS: The data of 186 patients (146 patients with TT and 40 with IDA) were enrolled. The interpretable rules derived from the RF model were proposed to demonstrate the combination of RBC indices for discriminating IDA from TT. A web-based tool 'ThalPred' was implemented using an SVM model based on seven RBC parameters. ThalPred achieved prediction results with an external accuracy, MCC and AUC of 95.59, 0.87 and 0.98, respectively. CONCLUSION: ThalPred and an interpretable rule were provided for distinguishing IDA from TT. For the convenience of health care team experimental scientists, a web-based tool has been established at http://codes.bio/thalpred/ by which users can easily get their desired screening test result without the need to go through the underlying mathematical and computational details.},

  abstract = {Vietnam has a high thalassemia burden. We collected blood samples from 5880 pregnant Vietnamese women during prenatal health checks to assess thalassemia carrier frequency using combined gap-polymerase chain reaction (gap-PCR) and targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). Thalassemia carriers were identified with prevalence of 13.13\% (772), including 7.82\% (460) carriers of {$\alpha$}-thalassemia ({$\alpha$}-thal), 5.31\% (312) carriers of {$\beta$}-thalassemia ({$\beta$}-thal), and 0.63\% (37) concurrent {$\alpha$}-/{$\beta$}-thal carriers. Deletional mutations (368) accounted for 80.0\% of {$\alpha$}-thal carriers, of which, ----SEA (Southeast Asian) (n = 254; 55.0\%) was most prevalent, followed by the --{$\alpha$}3.7 (rightward) (n = 66; 14.0\%) and --{$\alpha$}4.2 (leftward) (n = 45; 9.8\%) deletions. Hb Westmead (HBA2: c.369C{$>$}G) (n = 53) and Hb Constant Spring (Hb CS or HBA2: c.427T{$>$}C) (in 28) are the two most common nondeletional {$\alpha$}-globin variants, accounting for 11.5 and 6.0\% of {$\alpha$}-thal carriers. We detected 11 different {$\beta$}-thal genotypes. Hb E (HBB: c.79G{$>$}A) (in 211) accounted for 67.6\% of {$\beta$}-thal carriers. The most common {$\beta$}-thal genotypes were associated with mutations at codon 17 (A{$>$}T) (HBB: c.52A{$>$}T), codons 41/42 (--TTCT) (HBB: c.126\_129delCTTT), and codon 71/72 (+A) (HBB: c.217\_218insA) (prevalence 0.70\%, 0.68\%, and 0.2\%, respectively). Based on mutation frequencies calculated in this study, estimates of 5021 babies in Vietnam are affected with clinically severe thalassemia annually. Our data suggest a higher thalassemia carrier frequency in Vietnam than previously reported. We established that combining NGS with gap-PCR creates an effective large-scale thalassemia screening method that can detect a broad range of mutations.},

  abstract = {Introduction The Italian strategy to prevent neural tube defects is based on the periconceptional use of folic acid. This strategy implies a good capacity of control by women over their reproductive choices. Data and Methods Three sample surveys of delivering women were conducted in three birth centers in two Italian cities. Overall, 973 women were interviewed through a structured questionnaire. Information on women's socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge and use of folic acid and on counselling received by health professional in anticipation of and during pregnancy were collected. Logistic regression models were used to explore factors associated with the outcome variables. Results The prevalence of periconceptional use of folic acid was 37.9\%. Before or during pregnancy, about half of the women had received partial information on what folic acid is and its benefits but only half of them received information on the correct period of assumption. Internet is a primary source of information for women who have the ability to search for the information they need, and these are the more educated. Older women, better educated, and Italians were more likely to plan a pregnancy, to know the correct period of folic acid assumption and to take it. Among multiparous women, those who received correct information during the previous pregnancy were more likely to use periconceptional folic acid in the present pregnancy OR=6.83 (95\%CI:3.58-13.0). Conclusions The provision of information on the correct period of assumption of folic acid is associated with better knowledge and with its increasing use. Investing on provision of information instead of the directive approach represented by the compulsory fortification of food, appears an appropriate action. The prevalence of periconceptional use of folic acid is an expression of the level of women's empowerment which the public health services should always aim to improve.},

In 2018, a cross-sectional study was conducted on 967 MMT patients at two methadone clinics in Ho Chi Minh City that serve Vietnamese patients. Amphetamine-type stimulant use was assessed by rapid urine test and face-to-face interview using the Alcohol, Smoking, Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) tool. The prevalence of amphetamine-type stimulant use assessed by urine test was 25.4\%. According to ASSIST, the prevalence of moderate and high risk amphetamine-type stimulant use was 15.5\% and 1.1\%, respectively. Amphetamine-type stimulant use and hazardous use were more prevalent in younger patients, having a part-time job, drug injection, having a lower score of self-health assessment, treated with a higher dose of methadone and missing methadone dose in the past 3~months. By contrast, patients who were HIV positive were less likely to use amphetamine-type stimulants. Cannabis and heroin use were significantly associated with amphetamine-type stimulant use (OR~=~1.46; 95\% CI: 1.38-8.67; and OR~=~1.50; CI: 1.04-2.18, respectively) and hazardous use (OR~=~4.07; CI: 1.67-9.92; and OR~=~2.38; CI: 1.56-3.63, respectively).

The prenatal screening for DS is a key component of antenatal care and is recommended to be universally offered to women irrespective of age or background. The objective of this paper is to introduce a noninvasive and accurate diagnosis procedure for DS and to minimize social and financial cost of prenatal diagnosis. Recently, machine learning has received considerable attention in predictive analytics for medical problems. However, there is few its applications on DS prediction reported due to the difficulty of dealing with highly imbalanced and feature-correlated screening data. In this paper, we propose a cascaded machine learning framework designed for DS prediction based on three complementary stages: 1) pre-judgment with isolation forest technique, 2) model ensemble by voting strategy, and 3) final judgment using logistic regression approach. The experimental results show that the performance of this framework on maternal serum screening data set, when evaluated with different evaluation parameters, is superior to those of some machine learning methods. The best suggested combination of input features for DS screening is the group of alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, unconjugated estriol, and maternal age. In addition, our method has the potential to generate further accurate prediction for imbalanced and feature-correlated data, thereby providing a novel and effective approach for certain diseases analysis.},

Abstract: The triple test plays a very important role in identifying chromosomal disorders, in the prenatal screening of the second pregnancy trimester. The scope of our research resides in investigating the level of human chorionic gonadotropin, alpha-fetoprotein and unconjugated estriol (markers that make-up the triple test), in the serum sampled and analysed from a group of 135 pregnant women. The observation of the above mentioned markers is made in order to identify the pregnancies that present a higher risk for the appearance of chromosomal disorders. We also, decided to associate the values gathered for human chorionic gonadotropin, alpha-fetoprotein and unconjugated estriol, with the maternal age. The interpretation of the data was made using the PRISCA 4.0 software, considering by default the gestational age, smoking, in vitro fertilization, diabetic status, medical history of the mother. We must say that the patients were pregnant in the second trimester, period specific for triple test survey and are not the same patients included in the double test survey. Following the conducted biochemical analyses normal values were obtained, values that fit the ranges specified in the specific literature, but also values that were outside the normal ranges, indentifying in this way pregnancies with high risk for 21 and 18 trisomy.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trend data for causes of child death are crucial to inform priorities for improving child survival by and beyond 2015. We report child mortality by cause estimates in 2000-13, and cause-specific mortality scenarios to 2030 and 2035. METHODS: We estimated the distributions of causes of child mortality separately for neonates and children aged 1-59 months. To generate cause-specific mortality fractions, we included new vital registration and verbal autopsy data. We used vital registration data in countries with adequate registration systems. We applied vital registration-based multicause models for countries with low under-5 mortality but inadequate vital registration, and updated verbal autopsy-based multicause models for high mortality countries. We used updated numbers of child deaths to derive numbers of deaths by causes. We applied two scenarios to derive cause-specific mortality in 2030 and 2035. FINDINGS: Of the 6{$\cdot$}3 million children who died before age 5 years in 2013, 51{$\cdot$}8\% (3{$\cdot$}257 million) died of infectious causes and 44\% (2{$\cdot$}761 million) died in the neonatal period. The three leading causes are preterm birth complications (0{$\cdot$}965 million [15{$\cdot$}4\%, uncertainty range (UR) 9{$\cdot$}8-24{$\cdot$}5]; UR 0{$\cdot$}615-1{$\cdot$}537 million), pneumonia (0{$\cdot$}935 million [14{$\cdot$}9\%, 13{$\cdot$}0-16{$\cdot$}8]; 0{$\cdot$}817-1{$\cdot$}057 million), and intrapartum-related complications (0{$\cdot$}662 million [10{$\cdot$}5\%, 6{$\cdot$}7-16{$\cdot$}8]; 0{$\cdot$}421-1{$\cdot$}054 million). Reductions in pneumonia, diarrhoea, and measles collectively were responsible for half of the 3{$\cdot$}6 million fewer deaths recorded in 2013 versus 2000. Causes with the slowest progress were congenital, preterm, neonatal sepsis, injury, and other causes. If present trends continue, 4{$\cdot$}4 million children younger than 5 years will still die in 2030. Furthermore, sub-Saharan Africa will have 33\% of the births and 60\% of the deaths in 2030, compared with 25\% and 50\% in 2013, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Our projection results provide concrete examples of how the distribution of child causes of deaths could look in 15-20 years to inform priority setting in the post-2015 era. More evidence is needed about shifts in timing, causes, and places of under-5 deaths to inform child survival agendas by and beyond 2015, to end preventable child deaths in a generation, and to count and account for every newborn and every child.

  abstract = {Objective: Nuchal fold thickness is the best ultrasonographic predictor of fetal trisomy 21. However, the risk assigned on the basis of the commonly used threshold of nuchal fold thickness {$\geq$}6 mm does not take into consideration the significant associations between nuchal fold thickness and gestational age and between maternal age and Down syndrome. We propose a new method of calculating Down syndrome probability that takes into account both gestational age at examination and previously assessed probability of Down syndrome. Study Design: Nuchal fold thickness was measured at ultrasonographic examination at 14 to 22 weeks' gestation without previous knowledge of the fetal karyotype. Nuchal cystic hygromas were excluded from analysis. Statistical analyses included correlation, logistic regression to control for other ultrasonographic predictors of trisomy 21 and for maternal age, receiver operating characteristic curve, and likelihood ratios (defined as the ratio of the sensitivity to the false-positive rate). P {$<$} .05 was considered significant. Results: Mean gestational age at ultrasonography was 16.9 weeks' gestation (range, 14-22 weeks' gestation). Mean ({\textpm}SD) nuchal fold thickness in fetuses with trisomy 21 (4.7 {\textpm} 1.6 mm; n = 29) was greater than in euploid fetuses (3.2 {\textpm} 0.9; n = 780; P {$<$} .001). Logistic regression analysis established that nuchal fold thickness was a significant predictor of trisomy 21 independent both of the other ultrasonographic markers and of maternal age (P {$<$} .001). Regression analysis showed that nuchal fold thickness was significantly correlated with gestational age among both fetuses with trisomy 21 and euploid fetuses and that the regression line of fetuses with trisomy 21 had a slope similar to that of euploid fetuses. The difference between observed and expected nuchal fold thicknesses on the basis of the biparietal diameter (as a function of gestational age) was used to obviate the confounding effect of gestational age. Differences between observed and expected nuchal fold thicknesses were then used to calculate likelihood ratios. These likelihood ratios could then be multiplied by the individual prior probability to obtain a patient-specific Down syndrome probability. Conclusion: Nuchal fold thickness is correlated with gestational age in both euploid fetuses and fetuses with Down syndrome. Use of the difference between observed and expected nuchal fold thicknesses to determine likelihood ratios allows the calculation of individual posterior probabilities of Down syndrome that take into consideration both gestational age and maternal age.

Retrospective assessment of the biparietal diameter, femur length, and biparietal diameter/femur length ratio in 55 fetuses with Down syndrome and 544 control fetuses was performed at two medical centers. Adequate numbers of cases and controls were available to permit statistically significant comparisons between the groups at 15 to 23 weeks' gestation. Fetuses with Down syndrome displayed no statistically significant differences in the cephalic index or the biparietal diameter compared with controls at a given gestational age. Significant femur length shortening was observed, but the greatest statistical difference was noted for the biparietal diameter/femur length ratio. This ratio was found to decrease with gestational age in the normal population and was consistently elevated in the Down syndrome population (compared with control) throughout the second trimester. With a cutoff value of 1.5 SD above the normal population mean for the biparietal diameter/femur length ratio, 50\% to 70\% of fetuses with Down syndrome could be identified in 6\% of the total population (p {$<$} 0.0001). This preliminary study suggests that the biparietal diameter/femur length ratio may prove superior to current Down syndrome screening methods and, as a third independent variable, may significantly enhance the sensitivity and specificity of combined maternal age/maternal serum {$\alpha$}-fetoprotein screening modalities.},

Although AI has been developed for screening and assisted decision-making in disease prevention and management, it has not yet been validated for systematic application in the clinic. In the context of rare diseases, the main strategy has been to build specialized care centres; however, these centres are scattered and their coverage is insufficient, which leaves a large proportion of rare-disease patients with inadequate care. Here, we show that an AI agent using deep learning, and involving convolutional neural networks for diagnostics, risk stratification and treatment suggestions, accurately diagnoses and provides treatment decisions for congenital cataracts in an in silico test, in a website-based study, in a `finding a needle in a haystack' test and in a multihospital clinical trial. We also show that the AI agent and individual ophthalmologists perform equally well. Moreover, we have integrated the AI agent with a cloud-based platform for multihospital collaboration, designed to improve disease management for the benefit of patients with rare diseases.},

  abstract = {Congenital heart defects (CHD) is one of the most common birth defects in China. Many studies have examined risk factors for CHD, but their predictive abilities have not been evaluated. In particular, few studies have attempted to predict risks of CHD from, necessarily unbalanced, population-based cross-sectional data. Therefore, we developed and validated machine learning models for predicting, before and during pregnancy, women's risks of bearing children with CHD. We compared the results of these models in a large-scale, comprehensive population-based retrospective cross-sectional epidemiological survey of birth defects in six counties in Shanxi Province, China, covering 2006 to 2008. This contained 78 cases of CHD among 33831 live births. We constructed nine synthetic variables to use in the models: maternal age, annual per capita income, family history, maternal history of illness, nutrition and folic acid deficiency, maternal illness in pregnancy, medication use in pregnancy, environmental risk factors in pregnancy, and unhealthy maternal lifestyle in pregnancy. The machine learning algorithms Weighted Support Vector Machine (WSVM) and Weighted Random Forest (WRF) were trained on, and a logistic regression (Logit) was fitted to, two-thirds of the data. Their predictive abilities were then tested in the remaining data. True positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), accuracy (ACC), area under the curves (AUC), G-means, and Weighted accuracy (WTacc) were used to compare the classification performance of the models. Median values, from repeating the data partitioning 1000 times, were used in all comparisons. The TPR and TNR of the three classifiers were above 0.65 and 0.93, respectively, better than any reported in the literature. TPR, wtACC, AUC and G were highest for WSVM, showing that it performed best. All three models are precise enough to identify groups at high risk of CHD. They should all be considered for future investigations of other birth defects and diseases.},

These calculations used a similar methodology to the previous estimates to examine changes over time.

There is a growing body of evidence that among risk factors that promote atherosclerosis, the metabolic syndrome is a powerful and prevalent predictor of cardiovascular events.

Interactions between the innate immune system with lipid-derived products seem to play a major role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis in relation with the metabolic syndrome. The multiple links among adipose tissue, the vascular wall, and the immune system are the topics of this review, which examines the roles of oxidized low-density lipoprotein, inflammatory cytokines, and adipokines in triggering and perpetuating a danger signal response that promotes the development of atherosclerosis.

Bivariate analyses compared children with Down syndrome with all other CSHCN. Multivariate analyses examined the role of demographic, socioeconomic, and medical factors on measures of care receipt and family impact. Results An estimated 98 000 CSHCN have Down syndrome nationally. Compared with other CSHCN, children with Down syndrome had a greater number of co-morbid conditions, were more likely to have unmet needs, faced greater family impacts, and were less likely to have access to a medical home. These differences become more pronounced for children without insurance and from low socioeconomic status families. Conclusions Children with Down syndrome disproportionately face greater disease burden, more negatively pronounced family impacts, and greater unmet needs than other CSHCN. Promoting medical homes at the practice level and use of those services by children with Down syndrome and other CSHCN may help mitigate these family impacts.},

Nevertheless, few epidemiologic studies have evaluated the effect of paternal age on the risk of more common birth defects. We examined data from the British Columbia Health Surveillance Registry, which included a total of 9,660 cases of birth defects (22 specific defect groups). We chose matched controls from the birth files of British Columbia (1952-1973). With the exception of an unusual change in direction in the 45-49 years age category, we found a general pattern of increasing relative risk estimates (adjusted for maternal age and other factors) with increasing paternal age for neural tube defects, congenital cataracts, reduction defects of the upper limb, and Down syndrome. For example, the adjusted relative risk estimates for neural tube defects in the offspring were 1.2 (for fathers age 30-34 years relative to 25-29 years); 1.3 (35-39); 1.6 (40-44); 0.6 (45-49); and 2.3 (men 50 years and older). Men under 20 years of age were also at increased risk for fathering children with birth defects such as neural tube defects, hypospadias, cystic kidney, and Down syndrome. We hypothesize that among certain commonly observed birth defects a subgroup of cases may be due to new, unrecognized dominant mutations.},

  abstract = {\textbf{\emph{Background:}} Implementation of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) in Down syndrome screening programmes requires health policy decisions about its combination with other tests and its timing in pregnancy. \textbf{\emph{Aim:}} Our aim was to aid health policy decision makers by conducting a quantitative analysis of different NIPT implementation strategies. \textbf{\emph{Methods:}} Decision trees were created to illustrate all plausible alternatives in a theoretical cohort of 100,000 pregnant women in five screening programmes: classical screening by the first-trimester combined test (FCT), pre-selection of high-risk women prior to NIPT by the FCT, NIPT as the first screening test at 10 weeks and at 13 weeks, and the simultaneous conductance of NIPT and the FCT. \textbf{\emph{Results:}} Pre-selection by FCT prior to NIPT reduces the number of amniocenteses to a minimum because of a reduction of false-positive NIPT results. If NIPT is the first screening test, it detects almost all fetal Down syndrome cases. NIPT at 10 weeks reassures women early in pregnancy, while NIPT at 13 weeks prevents unnecessary tests due to spontaneous miscarriages and allows for immediate confirmation by amniocentesis. \textbf{\emph{Conclusion:}} Every implementation strategy has its advantages and disadvantages. The most favourable implementation strategy may be NIPT as the first screening test at 13 weeks, offering the most accurate screening test for Down syndrome, when the risk for spontaneous miscarriage has declined remarkably and timely confirmation by amniocentesis can be performed.},

  abstract = {Introduction Anaemia in women during pregnancy and child bearing age is one of the most common global health problems. Reasons are numerous, but in many cases only minimal attempts are made to elucidate the underlying causes. In this study we aim to identify aetiology of anaemia in women of child bearing age and to determine the relative contributions, effects and interactions of {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-thalassaemia in a region of the world where thalassaemia is endemic. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted at the Colombo North Teaching Hospital of Sri Lanka. The patient database of deliveries between January 2015 and September 2016 at University Obstetrics Unit was screened to identify women with anaemia during pregnancy and 253 anaemic females were randomly re-called for the study. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and haematological investigations were done to identify aetiologies. Results Out of the 253 females who were anaemic during pregnancy and were re-called, 8 were excluded due to being currently pregnant. Of the remaining 245 females, 117(47.8\%) remained anaemic and another 22(9.0\%) had non-anaemic microcytosis. Of anaemic females, 28(24.8\%) were iron deficient, 40(35.4\%) had low-normal serum ferritin without fulfilling the criteria for iron deficiency,18(15.3\%) had {$\beta$}-haemoglobinopathy trait and 20(17.0\%) had {$\alpha$}-thalassaemia trait. Of females who had non-anaemic microcytosis, 14(66.0\%) had {$\alpha$}-thalassaemia trait. In 4 females, both {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-thalassaemia trait coexist. These females had higher levels of haemoglobin (p = 0.06), MCV (p{$<$}0.05) and MCH (p{$<$}0.01) compared to individuals with only {$\beta$}-thalassaemia trait. A significantly higher proportion of premature births (p{$<$}0.01) and lower mean birth weights (p{$<$}0.05) were observed in patients with {$\alpha$}-thalassaemia trait. Conclusions Nearly one third of anaemic females in child bearing age had thalassaemia trait of which {$\alpha$}-thalassemia contributes to a majority. Both {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-thalassaemia trait can co-exist and have ameliorating effects on red cell indices in heterozygous states. {$\alpha$}-Thalassaemia trait was significantly associated with premature births and low birth weight. It is of paramount importance to investigate the causes of anaemia in women of child bearing age and during pregnancy in addition to providing universal iron supplementation.},

  abstract = {Trisomy 13 (T13) and trisomy 18 (T18) are among the most prevalent autosomal trisomies. Both are associated with a very high risk of mortality. Numerous instances, however, of long-term survival of children with T13 or T18 have prompted some clinicians to pursue aggressive treatment instead of the traditional approach of palliative care. The purpose of this study is to assess current mortality data for these conditions. This multi-state, population-based study examined data obtained from birth defect surveillance programs in nine states on live-born infants delivered during 1999-2007 with T13 or T18. Information on children's vital status and selected maternal and infant risk factors were obtained using matched birth and death certificates and other data sources. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate age-specific survival probabilities and predictors of survival up to age five. There were 693 children with T13 and 1,113 children with T18 identified from the participating states. Among children with T13, 5-year survival was 9.7\%; among children with T18, it was 12.3\%. For both trisomies, gestational age was the strongest predictor of mortality. Females and children of non-Hispanic black mothers had the lowest mortality. Omphalocele and congenital heart defects were associated with an increased risk of death for children with T18 but not T13. This study found survival among children with T13 and T18 to be somewhat higher than those previously reported in the literature, consistent with recent studies reporting improved survival following more aggressive medical intervention for these children. {\copyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Objective The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of nuchal translucency measurement as a marker of adverse pregnancy outcome in karyotypically normal fetuses. Methods During the years 1995--99, nuchal translucency (NT) measurement was routinely offered to all women who had their dating scan in our unit. From the data collected, we calculated the 95th and 99th centiles of the NT for a given crown--rump length using regression analysis. The NT measurements were analyzed in relation to pregnancy outcome, especially with regards to miscarriage, intrauterine death and diagnosis of fetal structural abnormalities, after excluding chromosomal abnormalities. Results The pregnancy outcome was available in 6650 (89\%) of the 7500 pregnancies. In fetuses with an NT over the 99th centile, 17.8\% (relative risk 12.2, 95\% CI 7.2--20.8) had an adverse pregnancy outcome (miscarriage, intrauterine death, or termination for fetal abnormality) versus 1.5\% for those with a normal measurement. The incidence of structural abnormalities, especially heart defects, was significantly increased in the high-NT groups. Three out of 11 fetuses with major cardiac abnormalities had an NT measurement over the 99th centile. The calculated relative risk for major heart defects in fetuses with increased NT was 33.5 (95\% CI 9--123). Conclusion In the setting of routine antenatal screening, an increased NT measurement is a marker of a high-risk pregnancy even in karyotypically normal fetuses. In addition, the increased incidence of structural abnormalities makes the close follow-up of these pregnancies imperative and should include specialized fetal echocardiography.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe patterns among people who inject drugs (PWID), risk-related behaviours and access to methadone treatment, in order to design a large-scale intervention aiming to end the HIV epidemic in Haiphong, Vietnam. METHODS: A respondent-driven sampling (RDS) survey was first conducted to identify profiles of drug use and HIV risk-related behaviour among PWID. A sample of PWID was then included in a one-year cohort study to describe access to methadone treatment and associated factors. RESULTS: Among the 603 patients enrolled in the RDS survey, 10\% were female, all were injecting heroin and 24\% were using methamphetamine, including 3 (0.5\%) through injection. Different profiles of risk-related behaviours were identified, including one entailing high-risk sexual behaviour (n=37) and another involving drug-related high-risk practices (n=22). High-risk sexual activity was related to binge drinking and methamphetamine use. Among subjects with low sexual risk, sexual intercourse with a main partner with unknown serostatus was often unprotected. Among the 250 PWID included in the cohort, 55.2\% initiated methadone treatment during the follow-up (versus 4.4\% at RDS); methamphetamine use significantly increased. The factors associated with not being treated with methadone after 52 weeks were fewer injections per month and being a methamphetamine user at RDS. CONCLUSION: Heroin is still the main drug injected in Haiphong. Methamphetamine use is increasing markedly and is associated with delay in methadone initiation. Drug-related risks are low but sexual risk behaviours are still present. Comprehensive approaches are needed in the short term.},

The folate status of the neonate tends to be protected at the expense of maternal stores; nevertheless, there is mounting evidence that inadequate maternal folate status during pregnancy may lead to low infant birthweight, thereby conferring risk of developmental and long-term adverse health outcomes. Moreover, folate-related anemia during childhood and adolescence might predispose children to further infections and disease. The role of folic acid in prevention of neural tube defects (NTD) is now established, and several studies suggest that this protection may extend to some other birth defects. In terms of maternal health, clinical vitamin B12 deficiency may be a cause of infertility or recurrent spontaneous abortion. Starting pregnancy with an inadequate vitamin B12 status may increase risk of birth defects such as NTD, and may contribute to preterm delivery, although this needs further evaluation. Furthermore, inadequate vitamin B12 status in the mother may lead to frank deficiency in the infant if sufficient fetal stores of vitamin B12 are not laid down during pregnancy or are not available in breastmilk. However, the implications of starting pregnancy and lactation with low vitamin B12 status have not been sufficiently researched.},

The proposed artificial neural networks models were optimized in the sense of reaching a minimum false positive rate and at the same time securing a 100\% detection rate for Trisomy 21. These systems correctly identify other aneuploidies (Trisomies 13\&18, Turner, and Triploid syndromes) at a detection rate greater than 80\%.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of fetal trisomy 21 (T21) and other chromosomal abnormalities (OCA) at 11-13\,weeks' gestation using computational intelligence classification methods. METHODS: As a first step, a training dataset consisting of 72\,054 euploid pregnancies, 295 cases of T21 and 305 cases of OCA was used to train an artificial neural network. Then, a two-stage approach was used for stratification of risk and diagnosis of cases of aneuploidy in the blind set. In Stage 1, using four markers, pregnancies in the blind set were classified into no risk and risk. No-risk pregnancies were not examined further, whereas the risk pregnancies were forwarded to Stage 2 for further examination. In Stage 2, using seven markers, pregnancies were classified into three types of risk, namely no risk, moderate risk and high risk. RESULTS: Of 36\,328 unknown to the system pregnancies (blind set), 17\,512 euploid, two T21 and 18 OCA were classified as no risk in Stage 1. The remaining 18\,796 cases were forwarded to Stage 2, of which 7895 euploid, two T21 and two OCA cases were classified as no risk, 10\,464 euploid, 83\,T21 and 61 OCA as moderate risk and 187 euploid, 50\,T21 and 52 OCA as high risk. The sensitivity and the specificity for T21 in Stage 2 were 97.1\% and 99.5\%, respectively, and the false-positive rate from Stage 1 to Stage 2 was reduced from 51.4\% to {$\sim$}1\%, assuming that the cell-free DNA test could identify all euploid and aneuploid cases. CONCLUSION: We propose a method for early diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities that ensures that most T21 cases are classified as high risk at any stage. At the same time, the number of euploid cases subjected to invasive or cell-free DNA examinations was minimized through a routine procedure offered in two stages. Our method is minimally invasive and of relatively low cost, highly effective at T21 identification and it performs better than do other existing statistical methods.

The research for frequency of some ethnics almost in electrophoresis includes: Kinh (beta thalassemia carrier 1.49\%, HbE 1.24\%), Muong (beta thalassemia carrier 10.7\%, HbE 11.7\%), Tay (beta thalassemia carrier 11\%, HbE 1\%). In the recent years, we have conducted researches on thalassemia gene in the Northern and Southern areas of Vietnam. The two researches on beta thalassemia conducted at National Hospital of Pediatrics were Cd17 (33.8\%), Cd41/42 (29.4\%) following are HbE (19.1\%), Cd 71/72 (7.3\%), -28 (5.9\%), IVS 2-625 (1.5\%), IVS 1-5 (1.5\%), IVS 1-1 (1.5\%). In Vietnam, we have a thalassemia centre at the National Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion and several outpatient clinics at National Hospital of Pediatrics, Children No. 1 Hospital, Blood Transfusion and Hematology Hospital Ho Chi Minh city, Central Hue Hospital. In provincial hospitals, we have transfusion service but very variance. That the number of patients with thalassemia requires regular blood transfusion has been increasing results in big shortage of blood supply. At Department of Clinical Hematology-NHP, we provide patients with screening for HIV, HCV and HBV in every 6 months. Patients were done antibody screening test. Deferoxamine, deferiprone and deferasirox are currently used but in short supply. We are facing the difficulty that almost hospitals in Vietnam lack the drug which is unique for each type of chelation. We have to apply ferritin level to follow the chelation effective and MRI to measure iron overload in patients' liver and heart. We are only able to provide SCT for the modest number of patients with thalassemia. In almost cases, we used sibling donor in SCT for patients with thalassemia. Regarding prevention service, we offer genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis at three hospitals. We organized prevention program in Hoa Binh province on national budget. The most important future planning is expanding prevention program in provinces with high prevalence and after that in the all country. Our future plan is to set up more thalassemia centres in provincial and central hospitals where overload with patient's demand. We also launch for appeal for blood and iron chelation to patients with thalassemia. In near future, use of haplo SCT to treatment thalassemia patients will be more.},

A total of 298 ethnic minority women, the C{\'o}-Tu, participated. Hematological parameters and hemoglobin profiles were analyzed using standard automated analyzers. Alpha- and beta-thalassemia mutations were identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based technology. Of the 298 women, 141 (47.3\%) carried thalassemia genes. Hemoglobin Constant Spring (Hb CS) is the most common with a markedly high frequency of 0.143 (overall prevalence=26.2\%). The heterozygous state of Hb CS was found in one-fifth (20.5\%) of women participating. Seven women (2.4\%) were Hb CS homozygote. The overall prevalence for Hb E was 13.8\%, and 10.7\% for {$\alpha$}+-thalassemia. Other forms of thalassemia included 0.67\% {$\beta$}-thalassemia, and 0.34\% Hb Paks{\'e}. None of the participants had the {$\alpha$}0-thalassemia gene. The study provides basic epidemiological information about Hb CS as well as other forms of thalassemia for a specific group of an ethnic minority in Vietnam. The data will be useful for further study on the distribution of thalassemia in Southeast Asia.},

HIV prevalence among injecting drug users is 20\% and up to 50\% in many provinces. An estimated number of drug users in the country by the end of 2011 were 171,000 in which the most common is heroin (85\%). Detoxification at home, community, and in rehabilitation centers have been the main modalities for managing heroin addiction until Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) was piloted in 2008. Recent reports have demonstrated positive treatment outcomes. Incidence of HIV was found remarkably low among patients on MMT. Treatment has significantly improved the quality of life as well as stability for society. The government has granted the Ministry of Health (MoH) to expand Methadone treatment to at least 30 provinces to provide treatment for more than 80,000 drug users by 2015. The Vietnam Administration for HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC) and MOH have outlined the role and responsibility of key departments at the central and local levels in implementing and maintaining MMT treatment. This paper will describe the achievements of the MMT pilot program and the scaling-up plan as well as strategies to ensure quality and sustainability and to overcome the challenges in the coming years.},

We employed the 2015 Vietnam District and Commune Health Facility Survey which was a cross-sectional study designed by the World Bank in collaboration with the Vietnam Health Strategy and Policy Institute. This survey was designed to be representative of six provinces (Dien Bien, Hanoi, Binh Dinh, Dak Lak, Dong Nai, and Dong Thap) drawn from six distinct geographical regions of Vietnam. Data from 4949 outpatients at district hospitals (DHs) and 1724 outpatients at commune health centers (CHCs) were extracted for final analysis. We recorded average outpatient waiting times of 32.58 min at DHs and of 11.58 min at CHCs. Four hundred and forty-five outpatients at DHs (9.0\%) and 720 those at CHCs (42.8\%) were examined immediately (waiting time = 0 min). Outpatient waiting times were various in six distinct geographical regions. With an investigation according to several socioeconomic characteristics, significant differences in outpatient waiting times were observed at both two levels of health facilities as measured by province, age, self-reported health status, patient's wealth, ethnicity, and health insurance. Conclusions. Outpatient waiting times from arrival at health facility until receiving care were significantly distinct amongst two health facility levels, revealing longer at DHs compared to at CHCs. There was significantly higher proportion of outpatients examined immediately at CHCs compared to at DHs. Our study suggests that, vulnerable populations, with longer outpatient waiting time, should be dealt with in appropriate models towards each medical facility according to key socioeconomic factors to contribute to simplify the process of medical examination and treatment for outpatients.},

We show that maximum margin methods such as boosted trees and boosted stumps push probability mass away from 0 and 1 yielding a characteristic sigmoid shaped distortion in the predicted probabilities. Models such as Naive Bayes, which make unrealistic independence assumptions, push probabilities toward 0 and 1. Other models such as neural nets and bagged trees do not have these biases and predict well calibrated probabilities. We experiment with two ways of correcting the biased probabilities predicted by some learning methods: Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression. We qualitatively examine what kinds of distortions these calibration methods are suitable for and quantitatively examine how much data they need to be effective. The empirical results show that after calibration boosted trees, random forests, and SVMs predict the best probabilities.},

Ratios of measured humerus length/predicted humerus length and measured femur length/predicted femur length were calculated for each fetus. Results: Eleven of 45 (24.4\%) fetuses with Down's syndrome had short humerus (measured humerus length/predicted humerus length ratio of {$\leq$}0.89), and 11 (24.4\%) had short femur (measured femur length/predicted femur length ratio of {$\leq$}0.91. In comparison, among 942 karyotypically normal fetuses only 43 (4.5\%) showed short humerus and 44 (4.7\%) showed short femur (p {$<$} 0.05). Fetuses with both short humerus and short femur carried an 11-fold greater risk of Down's syndrome (risk ratio = 11.1; 95\% confidence interval = 5.0 to 25.0). Conclusion: Prenatal ultrasonographic detection of short humerus to short femur, or both significantly increase the risk of Down's syndrome; this information may be useful in screening programs.},

In the first 1,000 of these 2,000 fetuses delivered thus far there were 8 cases of Trisomy 21, 2 of Trisomy 18 and 1 of 47 XXX. Nine of these 11 were screen positive, the only false negative results being for 2 cases of Trisomy 21. The detection rate for Trisomy 21 was 6 out of 8 (75\%) and for every case of Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) detected by this process, 11.3 invasive tests would have been needed to make that diagnosis in a screen positive woman.},

Obesity affects all socioeconomic backgrounds and ethnicities and is a pre-requisite for metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a clustering of risk factors, such as central obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and hypertension that together culminate in the increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. As these conditions are among the leading causes of deaths worldwide and metabolic syndrome increases the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus fivefold and cardiovascular disease threefold, it is of critical importance that a precise definition is agreed upon by all interested parties. Also of particular interest is the relationship between metabolic syndrome and cancer. Metabolic syndrome has been associated with a plethora of cancers including breast, pancreatic, colon and liver cancer. Furthermore, each individual risk factor for metabolic syndrome has also an association with cancer. Our review collates internationally generated information on metabolic syndrome, its many definitions and its associations with life-threatening conditions including type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and cancer, providing a foundation for future advancements on this topic.},

Certain complications or disorders that can appear during pregnancy can endanger the life of both mother and fetus. There is enough scientific literature to support the idea that emotional aspects can be a relevant risk factor in pregnancy (such as anxiety, stress or depression, for instance). This paper presents a scoping review of the scientific literature from the past 12 years (2008-2020) to identify which methodologies, techniques, algorithms and frameworks are used in Artificial Intelligence and Affective Computing for pregnancy health and well-being. The methodology proposed by Arksey and O'Malley, in conjunction with PRISMA-ScR framework has been used to create this review. Despite the relevance that emotional status can have as a risk factor during pregnancy, one of the main findings of this study is that there is still not a significant amount of literature on automatic analysis of emotion. Health enhancement and well-being for pregnant women can be achieved with artificial intelligence or affective computing based devices, hence future work on this topic is strongly suggested.},

The ratio of the observed number of fetal trisomies to that expected on the basis of maternal age was calculated.ResultsThe incidence of trisomies 21, 18, or 13 was 18\% (102 of 560 cases) and was significantly associated with both maternal age (r = 0.97) and fetal nuchal translucency thickness (r = 0.75). In 383 fetuses with nuchal translucency of 3 mm, the observed number of fetal trisomies was 23, in contrast to the frequency of 6.0 expected on the basis of maternal age. In 177 fetuses with nuchal translucency of 4 mm or more, 79 cases were observed, compared with 2.7 expected on the basis of maternal age. In fetuses with nuchal translucency of 4 mm or more and normal karyotype, there was a high association with other defects and the prognosis was often poor, whereas the translucency resolved for those with 3 mm and the pregnancy outcome was usually normal.ConclusionAt 10-13 weeks' gestation, fetal nuchal translucency of 3 mm is associated with a fourfold increase, and translucency of greater than 3 mm with a 29-fold increase, in the maternal age-related risk for trisomies 21, 18, and 13. Fetal nuchal translucency of 4 mm or more is associated with poor pregnancy outcome even when the fetal karyotype is normal.},

BJOG 2011;118:1438--1445. Background Heart defects are the most common congenital abnormalities. Objective We aimed to evaluate in a meta-analysis the screening performance of abnormal ductus venosus (DV) Doppler waveform for detection of congenital heart disease (CHD) in chromosomally normal fetuses. Search strategy Studies were retrieved from a search of MEDLINE, ISI, SCOPUS and EMBASE (from 1999 to March 2011) using the keywords `ductus venosus', `DV', `chromosomal abnormalities', `congenital heart disease' and `nuchal translucency'. Selection criteria We considered all studies that examined the diagnostic performance of DV in the first trimester for CHD in chromosomally normal fetuses. We included studies that were limited to fetuses with increased nuchal translucency (NT), normal NT, and studies that examined fetuses regardless of NT status. Data collection and analysis Seven studies (n = 50 354) regardless of the NT status, nine studies (n = 2908) with increased NT and seven studies (n = 47 610) with normal NT were included in the meta-analysis. We drew hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curves using the parameters of the fitted models. Main results In populations including participants regardless of NT status, the summary sensitivity and specificity of DV for detecting CHD were 50 and 93\%, respectively. In participants with increased NT, the summary sensitivity and specificity were 83 and 80\%, and in those with normal NT, they were 19 and 96\%, respectively. Authors' conclusions The estimated performance of DV assessment for detection of CHD in chromosomally normal fetuses can be considered in evaluating the potential use and limitations of this screening test.},

  abstract = {Iodine deficiency affects more than 2.2 billion individuals worldwide (38\% of the world's population). Decreases in maternal T4 associated with even mild iodine deficiency may have adverse effects on the cognitive function of offspring (1, 2), and iodine deficiency remains the leading cause of preventable mental retardation worldwide. It has recently been suggested that mild iodine deficiency may also be associated with attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorders in offspring (3).Dietary iodine requirements are increased in pregnant women for several reasons. Maternal thyroid hormone production normally increases by about 50\% during gestation, starting during the first trimester, due to human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation of the TSH receptor and because high estrogen levels induce an increase in the sialylation of T4-binding globulin (TBG), leading to reduced hepatic TBG clearance and increased concentrations of circulating TBG (4, 5). In addition, the peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormone may be increased, especially in the second half of pregnancy, due to placental deiodination of T4 to the bioinactive reverse T3 (6). By at least wk 10--12 of pregnancy, some maternal iodine stores are transferred to the fetus to allow for hormone production in the fetal thyroid; the amount of iodine transferred in this way is unclear (7). Finally, the glomerular filtration rate of iodide increases early in pregnancy, increasing renal iodide clearance and decreasing the circulating pool of plasma iodine (8). To compensate for renal iodine losses, there is an increased rate of uptake of iodine into the thyroid gland in pregnant women (7).},

  abstract = {Background As a result of poor economic opportunities and an increasing shortage of affordable housing, much of the spatial growth in many of the world's fastest-growing cities is a result of the expansion of informal settlements where residents live without security of tenure and with limited access to basic infrastructure. Although inadequate water and sanitation facilities, crowding and other poor living conditions can have a significant impact on the spread of infectious diseases, analyses relating these diseases to ongoing global urbanization, especially at the neighborhood and household level in informal settlements, have been infrequent. To begin to address this deficiency, we analyzed urban environmental data and the burden of cholera in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Methodology/Principal Findings Cholera incidence was examined in relation to the percentage of a ward's residents who were informal, the percentage of a ward's informal residents without an improved water source, the percentage of a ward's informal residents without improved sanitation, distance to the nearest cholera treatment facility, population density, median asset index score in informal areas, and presence or absence of major roads. We found that cholera incidence was most closely associated with informal housing, population density, and the income level of informal residents. Using data available in this study, our model would suggest nearly a one percent increase in cholera incidence for every percentage point increase in informal residents, approximately a two percent increase in cholera incidence for every increase in population density of 1000 people per km2 in Dar es Salaam in 2006, and close to a fifty percent decrease in cholera incidence in wards where informal residents had minimally improved income levels, as measured by ownership of a radio or CD player on average, in comparison to wards where informal residents did not own any items about which they were asked. In this study, the range of access to improved sanitation and improved water sources was quite narrow at the ward level, limiting our ability to discern relationships between these variables and cholera incidence. Analysis at the individual household level for these variables would be of interest. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that ongoing global urbanization coupled with urban poverty will be associated with increased risks for certain infectious diseases, such as cholera, underscoring the need for improved infrastructure and planning as the world's urban population continues to expand.},

It is a relatively new approach for which a universal study definition or definitive procedure has not been established. The purpose of this scoping review was to provide an overview of scoping reviews in the literature. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. A search was conducted in four bibliographic databases and the gray literature to identify scoping review studies. Review selection and characterization were performed by two independent reviewers using pretested forms. RESULTS: The search identified 344 scoping reviews published from 1999 to October 2012. The reviews varied in terms of purpose, methodology, and detail of reporting. Nearly three-quarter of reviews (74.1\%) addressed a health topic. Study completion times varied from 2 weeks to 20 months, and 51\% utilized a published methodological framework. Quality assessment of included studies was infrequently performed (22.38\%). CONCLUSIONS: Scoping reviews are a relatively new but increasingly common approach for mapping broad topics. Because of variability in their conduct, there is a need for their methodological standardization to ensure the utility and strength of evidence.},

  abstract = {One of the most common congenital anomalies in fetuses is known to be Down syndrome (DS). DS causes various adverse effects on the quality and length of life of children having DS and their families. Therefore, prenatal screening and diagnosis for DS are essential and valuable in antenatal care. Recently, machine learning methods for DS detection have become widespread. However, the existing methods, which use the traditional machine learning models, usually have several limitations while facing imbalanced data and missing data. This paper proposes a multi-branch CNN model combined with a feature rearrangement approach to improve the quality of DS prediction from prenatal screening data. The proposed feature rearrangement approach utilizes Pearson correlation testing and feature grouping to create a proper arrangement for the CNN model. Despite the imbalanced and highly missing data, the experiments show promising results with a Recall of 0.9023, F1-score of 0.8969, and balanced accuracy of 0.9314. These achievements outperform several traditional machine learning and attention-based deep learning models.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To calculate a reliable estimate of the population prevalence of Down syndrome in the US. STUDY DESIGN: The annual number of births of infants with Down syndrome were estimated by applying published birth prevalence rates of Down syndrome by maternal age to US data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the years for which births by maternal age were available (1940-2008). Death certificate data for persons with Down syndrome were available for the years 1968-2007. We estimated the number of people with Down syndrome on January 1, 2008, using a life table approach based on proportions of deaths by age. Monte Carlo sampling was used to create 90\% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for our estimates. RESULTS: We estimated the January 1, 2008, population prevalence of Down syndrome as approximately 250700 (90\% UI, 185900-321700) based on proportions of deaths by age from the most recent 2 years (2006-2007) of death certificate data. This estimate corresponds to a prevalence of 8.27 people with Down syndrome per 10000 population (90\% UI, 6.14-10.62). CONCLUSION: Our estimate of Down syndrome prevalence is roughly 25\%-40\% lower than estimates based solely on current birth prevalence. The results presented here can be considered a starting point for facilitating policy and services planning for persons with Down syndrome.},

In our description of treatment strategies, we focus on how we deal with clinical manifestations and long-term complications using the most effective current treatment methods for {$\beta$}-thalassemia. The discussion of disease management focuses on our use of transfusion therapy and the newly developed oral iron chelators, deferiprone and deferasirox. We also deal with splenectomy and how we manage endocrinopathies and cardiac complications. In addition, we describe our use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which has produced cure rates as high as 97\%, and the use of cord blood transplantation. Finally, we briefly touch on therapies that might be effective in the near future, including new fetal hemoglobin inducers and gene therapy.},

DS individuals may have a high frequency of infections, usually of the upper respiratory tract, characterized by increased severity and prolonged course of disease, which are partially attributed to defects of the immune system. The abnormalities of the immune system associated with DS include: mild to moderate T and B cell lymphopenia, with marked decrease of naive lymphocytes, impaired mitogen-induced T cell proliferation, reduced specific antibody responses to immunizations and defects of neutrophil chemotaxis. Limited evidence of genetic abnormalities secondary to trisomy of chromosome 21 and affecting the immune system is available, such as the potential consequences of gene over-expression, most significantly SOD1 and RCAN1. Secondary immunodeficiency due to metabolic or nutritional factors in DS, particularly zinc deficiency, has been postulated. Non-immunological factors, including abnormal anatomical structures (e.g. small ear canal, tracheomalacia) and gastro-oesophageal reflux, may play a role in the increased frequency of respiratory tract infections. The molecular mechanisms leading to the immune defects observed in DS individuals and the contribution of these immunological abnormalities to the increased risk of infections require further investigation. Addressing immunological and non-immunological factors involved in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases may reduce the susceptibility to infections in DS subjects.},

As with any screening test, the patient should be made aware that a ``negative'' test or ``normal'' ultrasound does not guarantee a healthy baby and a ``positive'' test does not mean the fetus has the condition. The woman should have both pre- and post-test counseling to discuss the benefits, limitations, and options for additional testing. Rapid advancements of genetic technologies have made it possible to screen for the common aneuploidies traditionally associated with advanced maternal age with improved levels of accuracy beyond serum and ultrasound based testing.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, single-blind, diagnostic study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: 151 patients (78 male and 73 female subjects; mean age, 52.5 +/- 16.4 yr) presenting with acute or recent symptoms of vertigo. INTERVENTION: Diagnostic evaluation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The negative predictive value (NPV) of the triple test in relation to a normal caloric test response. RESULTS: In unilateral weakness (UW) on caloric testing (UW, {$>$}=25\%), the triple test had sensitivity of 63.6\%, specificity of 85.4\%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 71.4\%, and an NPV of 80.4\%. In other words, 80.4\% of patients with a negative triple test also had a normal response on caloric testing. In pronounced canal paresis (UW, {$>$}=50\%), the triple test had sensitivity of 81.8\%, specificity of 81.4\%, a PPV of 55.1\%, and an NPV of 94.1\%. Significant differences were found between 2 subgroups assessed by examiners with differing levels of experience (p {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSION: The triple test represents a good screening tool that quickly and reliably excludes unilateral weakness and in particular pronounced canal paresis on caloric testing.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), principally ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke, are the leading cause of global mortality and a major contributor to disability. This paper reviews the magnitude of total CVD burden, including 13 underlying causes of cardiovascular death and 9 related risk factors, using estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019. GBD, an ongoing multinational collaboration to provide comparable and consistent estimates of population health over time, used all available population-level data sources on incidence, prevalence, case fatality, mortality, and health risks to produce estimates for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Prevalent cases of total CVD nearly doubled from 271 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI]: 257 to 285~million)~in~1990 to 523 million (95\% UI: 497 to 550 million) in 2019, and the number of CVD deaths steadily increased from 12.1 million (95\% UI:11.4 to 12.6 million) in 1990, reaching 18.6 million (95\% UI: 17.1 to 19.7 million) in 2019. The global trends for disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years of life lost also increased significantly, and years lived with disability doubled from 17.7 million (95\% UI: 12.9 to 22.5 million) to 34.4 million (95\% UI:24.9 to 43.6 million) over that period. The total number of DALYs due to IHD has risen steadily since 1990, reaching 182 million (95\% UI: 170 to 194 million) DALYs, 9.14 million (95\% UI: 8.40 to 9.74 million) deaths in the year 2019, and 197 million (95\% UI: 178 to 220 million) prevalent cases of IHD in 2019. The total number of DALYs due to stroke has risen steadily since 1990, reaching 143 million (95\% UI: 133 to 153 million) DALYs, 6.55 million (95\% UI: 6.00 to 7.02 million) deaths in the year 2019, and 101 million (95\% UI: 93.2 to 111 million) prevalent cases of stroke in~2019. Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of disease burden in the world. CVD burden continues its decades-long rise for almost all countries outside high-income countries, and alarmingly, the age-standardized rate of CVD has begun to rise in some locations where it was previously declining in high-income countries. There is an urgent need to focus on implementing existing cost-effective policies and interventions if the world is to meet the targets for Sustainable Development Goal 3 and achieve a 30\% reduction in premature mortality due to noncommunicable diseases.},

  abstract = {Metabolic syndrome, variously known also as syndrome X, insulin resistance, etc., is defined by WHO as a pathologic condition characterized by abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Though there is some variation in the definition by other health care organization, the differences are minor. With the successful conquest of communicable infectious diseases in most of the world, this new non-communicable disease (NCD) has become the major health hazard of modern world. Though it started in the Western world, with the spread of the Western lifestyle across the globe, it has become now a truly global problem. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is often more in the urban population of some developing countries than in its Western counterparts. The two basic forces spreading this malady are the increase in consumption of high calorie-low fiber fast food and the decrease in physical activity due to mechanized transportations and sedentary form of leisure time activities. The syndrome feeds into the spread of the diseases like type 2 diabetes, coronary diseases, stroke, and other disabilities. The total cost of the malady including the cost of health care and loss of potential economic activity is in trillions. The present trend is not sustainable unless a magic cure is found (unlikely) or concerted global/governmental/societal efforts are made to change the lifestyle that is promoting it. There are certainly some elements in the causation of the metabolic syndrome that cannot be changed but many are amenable for corrections and curtailments. For example, better urban planning to encourage active lifestyle, subsidizing consumption of whole grains and possible taxing high calorie snacks, restricting media advertisement of unhealthy food, etc. Revitalizing old fashion healthier lifestyle, promoting old-fashioned foods using healthy herbs rather than oil and sugar, and educating people about choosing healthy/wholesome food over junks are among the steps that can be considered.},

Knowledge about the major elements of the natural history of substance use disorders (incidence, remission, persistence, and relapse) is crucial to a broader understanding of the course and outcomes of substance use disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Prospective cohort studies in nonclinical samples indicate that externalizing psychopathology in earlier life, including early disordered substance use, delinquency, and personality disorders, are related to substance use disorders later in life and chronic course. Externalizing psychopathology may be initiated by early adverse experiences, for example, childhood maltreatment and stressful life events. After controlling for confounders, 'age at first use' as a causal factor for alcohol use disorder later in life and the 'drug substitution' hypothesis are not supported in general population data. SUMMARY: Future research should focus on elaborating the causal framework that leads to the development and persistence of severe substance use disorders, with an emphasis on identifying modifiable factors for intervention by policy makers or health professionals. More research is needed on the natural history of substance use disorders in low-income and middle-income countries.},

However, for Patau syndrome (constitutional trisomy 13), which occurs in 1/10,000-1/20,000 live births, the tumor profile has not been well characterized. An awareness of susceptibility to malignancies can improve care of affected individuals, as well as further our understanding of the contribution of trisomy to carcinogenesis. Therefore, we conducted an extensive review of the literature; we found 17 malignancies reported in individuals with Patau syndrome. These comprised eight embryonic tumors, three leukemias, two malignant germ cell tumors, two carcinomas, a malignant brain tumor, and a sarcoma. Benign tumors were mainly extragonadal teratomas. The small number of reported malignant tumors suggests that there is not an increased risk of cancer in the context of trisomy 13. The tumor profile in Patau syndrome differs from that observed in Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) and Down syndrome (trisomy 21), suggesting that the supernumerary chromosome 13 could promote particular tumor formations as it does particular malformations. No general and direct relationships of tumor occurrence with organ weight, congenital malformations, histological changes, or presence of tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 13 were observed. However, some tumors were found in tissues whose growth and development are controlled by genes mapping to chromosome 13. Recent reports of successful outcomes following surgical treatment and adapted chemotherapy indicate that treatment of cancer is possible in Patau syndrome.},

The purpose of this study was to explore gender differences in the relationship between self-perceptions and 2 academic outcomes among a sample of 243 African American high school sophomores. The results suggest that, overall, females are more favorably oriented toward high school completion. Both male and female students with more positive self-perceptions have stronger intentions to complete the current year of high school. Higher grade point averages were more strongly associated with greater self-efficacy for females than for males. Given these findings, increased attention to educational programming, societal messages, and future research is warranted.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Responding to the high burden of cholera in developing countries, the WHO now considers vaccination as a supplement to the provision of safe drinking water and improved sanitation in the strategy for cholera control in endemic settings. Cultural concepts of illness affect many aspects of public health. In the first step of a two-step strategy to examine determinants of cholera vaccine acceptance, this study identified social and cultural features of diarrhoeal illness for cholera control in endemic communities. METHODS: A cultural epidemiological study with locally adapted vignette-based interviews was conducted in two cholera-endemic communities of Zanzibar. A random sample of unaffected peri-urban (n = 179) and rural (n = 177) adults was interviewed to study community ideas of cholera and shigellosis, considering categories of distress, perceived causes, and help-seeking behaviour. RESULTS: Cholera was recognised by 88\%. Symptoms of dehydration were most prominent in reports at the peri-urban site. Interference with work leading to strain on household finances was frequently emphasised. Dirty environment was the most prominent perceived cause, followed by unsafe drinking water and germ-carrying flies. Causes unrelated to the biomedical basis of cholera were reported more often by rural respondents. Rural women had more difficulty (20\%) to identify a cause than men (7.1\%, p = 0.016). Peri-urban self treatment emphasised rehydration; the rural community preferred herbal treatment and antibiotics. Shigellosis was recognised by 70\%. Fewer regarded it as very serious compared with cholera (76\% vs. 97\%, p {$<$} 0.001) and regarded it as less likely to be fatal (48\% vs. 78\%, p {$<$} 0.001). More respondents could not explain causes of shigellosis (23\%) compared with cholera (7.3\%, p {$<$} 0.001). Community respondents less frequently identified dehydration and contagiousness for shigellosis. Government facilities were preferred healthcare providers for both conditions. CONCLUSIONS: This study clarified local views of cholera and shigellosis relevant for diarrhoeal disease control in Zanzibar. The finding that rural women were less likely than men to specify causes of cholera suggests more attention to them is required. Better health education is needed for cholera in rural areas and for shigellosis in general. This study also identified variables for subsequent analysis of social and cultural determinants of cholera vaccine acceptance.},

  abstract = {Objective To test the performance of the ``Consecutive Combined Test'', applied on a high-risk population. The classic ``Combined Test'' (Double test (DT) and Nuchal Translucency (NT) measurement on the same day at app. week 12) gives detection rates (DR) for Down syndrome (DS) of 80--90\% for false positive rates (FPR) of 5\%. In affected pregnancies, however, the low PAPP-A level is more pronounced, the earlier in pregnancy. Thus, we hypothesized that the Double Test could be taken as early as from week 8 + 0, without compromising the excellent performance of the Combined Test. This ``Consecutive Combined Test'' allows for a centralised laboratory function. Methods Inclusion criteria were maternal age {$>$} 35 years (80\%) or a family history (20\%). Double test was taken at a median gestational age (GA) = 10 weeks. NT was measured at GA = 11 + 0 - 13 + 6. A combined risk estimate of {$>$} 1:400 at birth was used as cut-off. Results 881 had the full test. Screen positive = 34. CVS with aneuploidy = 11 (6 trisomy-21, 5 others). FPR = 3.2\%. Positive Predictive Value (PPV) = 17.6\% for T-21.

The purpose of this study was to establish more up to date information about hearing loss in children with DS. Methods: A 5-year longitudinal study following the otolaryngologic problems seen in children with DS was initiated in February, 1999 at the Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati, OH. Aggressive, `state of the art' treatment, both medical and surgical, was provided to a group of children, (n=48), all of whom were entered into the study at an age under 2 years. Specific interventions and treatments were reviewed in regards to following and treating the children's chronic ear disease. Hearing level results at the end of the first year of the study were evaluated in this publication. This includes both pre-treatment and post-treatment audiologic results. Results: After treatment of easily reversible hearing loss from chronic otitis media, either with medical or surgical treatment with PET's, 98\% of the children had normal hearing levels. Only two children had residual mild hearing losses after treatment interventions. Conclusion: Aggressive, meticulous and compulsive diagnosis and treatment of chronic ear disease in children with DS, started soon after birth, provides significantly improved hearing levels than reported previously.},

While some study designs are more prone to bias, its presence is universal. It is difficult or even impossible to completely eliminate bias. In the process of attempting to do so, new bias may be introduced or a study may be rendered less generalizable. Therefore, the goals are to minimize bias and for both investigators and readers to comprehend its residual effects, limiting misinterpretation and misuse of data. Numerous forms of bias have been described, and the terminology can be confusing, overlapping, and specific to a medical specialty. Much of the terminology is drawn from the epidemiology literature and may not be common parlance for radiologists. In this review, various types of bias are discussed, with emphasis on the radiology literature, and common study designs in which bias occurs are presented.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims There are limited data on mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) among patients who have received colonoscopy examinations. We sought to determine CRC mortality among persons undergoing colonoscopies compared with the general population. Methods We identified all individuals who had a colonoscopy as their first lower gastrointestinal endoscopy from April 1, 1987, to September 30, 2007 (24,342 men and 30,461 women), based on information from Manitoba's provincial physicians' billing claims database. Patients were followed until March 31, 2008, death, or migration out of the province (310,718 person-years). Individuals less than 50 years of age or more than 80 years of age at the index colonoscopy or those with prior sigmoidoscopy, inflammatory bowel disease, resective colorectal surgery, or CRC were excluded. CRC mortality after the index colonoscopy was compared with that of the general population by standardized mortality ratios (SMRs). Stratified analyses were performed to determine CRC mortality for different age groups at index colonoscopy and sex, duration of follow-up, medical specialty of the endoscopist, and site of CRC. Results There was a 29\% reduction in overall CRC mortality (SMR, 0.71; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.61--0.82], a 47\% reduction in mortality from distal CRC (SMR, 0.53; 95\% CI, 0.42--0.67), and no reduction in mortality from proximal CRC (SMR, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.77--1.17). The reduction in mortality from distal CRC remained significant for follow-up beyond 10 years (SMR, 0.53; 95\% CI, 0.31--0.84). Conclusions In Manitoba, colonoscopies significantly reduce mortality from CRC, but the benefit is not uniform for colorectal tumors that arise in different areas of the colon.},

  abstract = {Objective To pool published data regarding the sensitivity and specificity of nuchal translucency (NT) in the diagnosis of major congenital heart defects (CHDs) in fetuses with normal karyotype. Methods MEDLINE and Scopus searches using combinations of the terms `nuchal' and `cardiac*' were complemented by perusal of references of the retrieved articles and an additional automated search using the `search for related articles' function on PubMed. Only fetuses with normal karyotype and major CHDs were analyzed. Weighted estimates were made and summary receiver--operating characteristics curves were constructed. Results The analysis included 20 studies (205 232 fetuses; 537 cases with major CHDs). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of NT {$>$} 95th centile for diagnosis of major CHDs was 44.4\% (95\% CI, 39.5--49.5) and 94.5\% (95\% CI, 94.4--94.6), respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of NT {$>$} 99th centile was 19.5\% (95\% CI, 15.9--23.5) and 99.1\% (95\% CI, 99.1--99.2), respectively. For the subgroup of studies in which NT was measured by Fetal Medicine Foundation-certified operators, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of NT {$>$} 95th centile was 45.6\% (95\% CI, 39.6--51.7) and 94.7\% (95\% CI, 94.6--94.9), respectively. The corresponding estimates for NT {$>$} 99th centile were 21.0\% (95\%CI, 16.5--26.1) and 99.2\% (95\% CI, 99.2--99.3). The pooled positive likelihood ratio for NT {$>$} 99th centile was 30.5 (95\% CI, 24.3--38.6). There was high across-studies heterogeneity for most estimates. Conclusion Approximately 44\% of chromosomally normal fetuses with CHDs have NT {$>$} 95th centile and 20\% have NT {$>$} 99th centile. However, there is high heterogeneity across studies, which largely remains even in subgroup analyses of studies of apparently similar design, potentially indicating the presence of some residual unidentified bias.

  abstract = {Objective The aim of the present study was to assess possible correlations between ultrasound findings and maternal serum biochemical (`triple test') markers among fetuses with trisomy 21 in the second trimester of pregnancy. Methods The study was a retrospective cohort study of 72 pregnancies affected by trisomy 21 who had a second trimester ultrasound and biochemical screen performed at a single center between 1990 and 1999. The biochemical screen consisted of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), total beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and estriol (uE3). Marker levels were expressed in multiples of the median (MoM). The ultrasound findings assessed were major structural anomalies, short humerus length, short femur length, increased nuchal fold thickness (NF), hyperechoic bowel, echogenic intracardiac focus (EIF), ventriculomegaly, choroid plexus cysts and renal pyelectasis. Results Second trimester maternal serum biochemical markers and ultrasound findings appeared to be largely independent of each other. However, some significant correlations were observed. Estriol was significantly lower when a fetal cystic hygroma was detected on ultrasound compared to those with no cystic hygroma (0.40 vs 0.70 MoM, p{$<$}0.05). The median hCG level was significantly lower in those pregnancies with a normal second trimester fetal ultrasound compared to those with positive ultrasound findings (2.07 vs 2.87 MoM, p{$<$}0.05). Median hCG levels were also significantly higher in those cases with NF⩾5 mm as compared to those with NF{$<$}5 mm (2.99 vs 2.49 MoM, p{$<$}0.05). This difference persisted after exclusion of the five cases with cystic hygromas (2.99 vs 2.49 MoM, p{$<$}0.05). A significant positive correlation was observed between log10 hCG and log10 NF MoM (Spearman's {$\rho$}=0.252, p{$<$}0.05). NF was significantly greater among fetuses with an identifiable cardiac defect compared with those without a detectable cardiac defect (median of 7.0 mm vs 3.8 mm, p{$<$}0.01). This difference persisted when expressed as multiples of the median (2.8 vs 1.3 MoM, p{$<$}0.01). Conclusion Second trimester ultrasound and biochemical markers are largely independent in fetuses with trisomy 21, however significant correlations between the two were observed in the present series. These may be important in screening protocols that combine second trimester ultrasound and biochemical markers. Copyright {\copyright} 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

A retrospective case--control study of all cases of colon cancer diagnosed at our institution over a 5-year period was performed to determine the frequency of blood count abnormalities in these patients upon presentation. One hundred twenty-seven patients had right-sided colon cancer: 107 (84\%) had an elevated red cell distribution width (RDW); 87 (69\%) had anemia; and 70 (55\%) had a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Ninety-eight patients had left-sided colon cancer: 49 (50\%) had an elevated red cell distribution width; 43 (44\%) had anemia; and 22 (22\%) had a low mean corpuscular volume. The red cell distribution width was 84\% sensitive and 88\% specific for right-sided colon cancer. An elevated red cell distribution width may help better identify those patients who should be referred for full colonoscopy.},

During this time 30 cases of Down syndrome were identified either prenatally or postnatally. Using an established procedure the accuracy of predicted risk for Down syndrome was assessed in a population of 30 cases of Down syndrome and 11 758 unaffected pregnancies. The correlation between predicted risk and prevalence of Down syndrome was very high (r=0.9995). It is concluded that risks produced by the Fetal Medicine Foundation combined risk algorithm agree very closely with Down syndrome prevalence and can be used with confidence when counselling women of their risk.

  abstract = {In a first trimester study of 5422 Caucasian women, 752 Afro-Caribbean women and 170 Asian women we have shown that the median maternal serum marker MoMs for free {$\beta$}-hCG and PAPP-A were 19\% and 48\% higher in Afro-Caribbean women and 19\% higher and 35\% higher in Asian women, compared to Caucasian women. Correcting for maternal weight made very little difference to the effect in Afro-Caribbeans (21\% and 57\% higher after weight correction) but reduced the effect in Asians (4\% and 17\% higher after weight correction ). It is estimated that correcting for maternal weight and ethnicity overall would increase the detection rate by a modest 1.4\%. However, the effect on an individual's risk could result in as much as a two-fold increase in the patient specific risk for trisomy 21. The impact of ethnic origin seems to be greater than that observed with second trimester biochemical markers and larger studies are required in order to develop robust algorithms for correcting for ethnic origin in the first trimester.

  abstract = {Objective To determine the value and impact over a seven year period of a second trimester screening programme for trisomy 21 and trisomy 18, using the two maternal serum markers alpha-fetoprotein and free beta human chorionic gonadotrophin. Design Retrospective review. Setting A biochemical screening laboratory serving three health districts with three antenatal clinics in both teaching and nonteaching hospitals. Population 67,904 pregnancies in women of all ages screened between 14 and 22 weeks of gestation between 1 April 1991 and 31 March 1998. Methods All women booked into three major antenatal clinics were offered biochemical screening. Women at increased risk of trisomy 21 or trisomy 18 ({$\geq$} 1 in 250 at term) were offered an invasive diagnostic procedure. Follow up of the outcome of all pregnancies was performed. Main outcome measures Detection rate for trisomy 21 and trisomy 18, false positive rates, uptake of screening, uptake of amniocentesis in women identified at increased risk, prevalence of trisomy 21 at birth, detection and false positive rates by maternal age, fetal loss rate after amniocentesis, report turn around time, and identification of other anomalies. Results Overall, 87\% (67,904/78,501) of women underwent screening. The rate of detection of trisomy 21 was 75\% (80/107; 95\% CI 66 to 83) with a 5.1\% false positive rate (3466/67,904; CI 4.9 to 5.3\%). In women under 30 years of age the detection rate was 60\% (18/30; CI 41 to 77) with a 2.6\% false positive rate (956/36,371; CI 2.5 to 2.8). The rate of detection of trisomy 18 was 57\% (8/14; CI 29 to 82) with a 0.7\% false positive rate (475/67,904; CI 0.64 to 0.76). Uptake of amniocentesis was 83\% (2912/3508). Women were 3--3 times more likely to refuse amniocentesis if the risk was close to the cutoff (1 in 250) than if the risk was {$\geq$} 1 in 50. Fetal loss within 28 days of amniocentesis was 0.9\% (25/2912). Prenatal screening identified 84 other anomalies in addition to 41 cases of impending fetal death. Conclusion Second trimester prenatal screening for trisomy 21 and trisomy 18 using a simple two marker approach incorporating free beta hCG can achieve high detection rates over a long period of time. Health authorities who still have not introduced trisomy 21 screening should be encouraged by what can be achieved and should consider making such screening available to all women. Established second trimester detection rates of 75\% for a 5\% false positive rate will be the benchmark by which first trimester screening using nuchal translucency, PAPP--A and free beta hCG will be judged.},

Twenty-five population-based registries in 16 European countries provided data from 2000-2011. Cases included live births, fetal deaths (20+ weeks' gestation), and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFAs). The prevalence of associated anomalies was reported in live births. The prevalence of trisomy 18 and trisomy 13 were 4.8 (95\%CI: 4.7-5.0) and 1.9 (95\%CI: 1.8-2.0) per 10,000 total births. Seventy three percent of cases with trisomy 18 or trisomy 13 resulted in a TOPFA. Amongst 468 live born babies with trisomy 18, 80\% (76-83\%) had a cardiac anomaly, 21\% (17-25\%) had a nervous system anomaly, 8\% (6-11\%) had esophageal atresia and 10\% (8-13\%) had an orofacial cleft.

Coinheritance of {$\alpha$}-thalassemia with {$\beta$}0-thalassemia/Hb E produces a milder clinical phenotype in contrast to an interaction of {$\alpha$}-globin gene triplication in severe thalassemia. The mean steady-state Hb was also higher, whereas the mean corpuscular volume and the percentage of Hb F were markedly lower in the former group.

  abstract = {Background: Conventional diagnostic strategy for thalassemia carriers is time-consuming and requires many types of laboratory tests. Objective : To demonstrate the possibility of a combination of MCV or MCH and a PCR-based technique in identifying {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-thalassemia carriers in the population of the Northern Thailand in which molecular defects causing thalassemia are well documented. Materials and methods: Seventy northern Thai healthy adults with Hb12 g/dL, MCV 80 fL and MCH 27 pg were tested for the {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-globin gene mutations commonly found in Northern Thailand by a modified multiplex allele-specific PCR. The nucleotide sequencing was employed to confirm the results obtained from the PCR-based method. Results: A combination of MCV 80 fL or MCH 27 pg and a modified multiplex allele-specific PCR was able to definitely diagnose {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-thalassemia carriers in 81.4\% of the samples tested. These included single carriers of SEA-{$\alpha$} thalassemia 1, of {$\alpha$}-thalassemia 2 (3.7-kb deletion), of Hb Constant Spring, of HbE, of {$\beta$} 41/42(-TTCT) -thalassemia and of {$\beta$} 17(A-T) -thalassemia. These also included double carriers of {$\alpha$}-thalassemia 2 (3.7-kb deletion) and {$\beta$} 17(A-T) -thalassemia, double carrier of Hb Constant Spring and HbE, double carrier of SEA-{$\alpha$} thalassemia 1 and {$\beta$} 17A-T) -thalassemia and double carrier of {$\alpha$}-thalassemia 2 (3.7-kb deletion) and HbE. The results obtained from the modified multiplex allele-specific PCR completely agreed with those generated from the standard nucleotide sequencing. Conclusion: Combination of MCV or MCH and a modified multiplex allele-specific PCR might be an alternative means in detecting common {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-thalassemia carriers in northern Thailand. This strategy may be applied in other regions where thalassemia is endemic and globin gene mutations are well documented. Bull Chiang Mai Assoc Med Sci 2013; 46(1): 22-32}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine use is a growing public health concern in the United States. Prior analyses with nationally representative data from 2015 to 2017 suggested that increases in methamphetamine use appeared largely selective to people using heroin. This analysis updated prior estimates to determine if trends are selectively persistent and how they compare to historical trends. We also evaluate sociodemographic risk factors associated with methamphetamine use among people using heroin. METHODS: Data from the 2015-2019 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) were analyzed. Data from the 2006-2014 NSDUH were summarized for historical trends. Past month and past year methamphetamine use prevalence was determined within populations using heroin as well as those using other drugs (e.g., cocaine, cannabis). Multivariable logistic models accounting for complex survey design evaluated predictors of methamphetamine use among people using heroin. RESULTS: From 2015 to 2019, past month methamphetamine use increased from 9.0\% to 44.0\% within the population of people reporting past month heroin use. Similarly, past year methamphetamine use increased from 22.5\% to 46.7\% among those reporting past year heroin use. Risk factors for methamphetamine use among people using heroin included rurality, past year injection drug use, and serious mental illness. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid, selective, and sustained increase in methamphetamine use is evident among people using heroin. These findings combined with similar findings in treatment admission and overdose data emphasize the need for increased attention to a specific type of high-risk use pattern in the United States, an issue that appears increasingly unlikely to naturally resolve.},

  abstract = {Background: Predictions in pregnancy care are complex because of interactions among multiple factors. Hence, pregnancy outcomes are not easily predicted by a single predictor using only one algorithm or modeling method. Objective: This study aims to review and compare the predictive performances between logistic regression (LR) and other machine learning algorithms for developing or validating a multivariable prognostic prediction model for pregnancy care to inform clinicians' decision making. Methods: Research articles from MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were reviewed following several guidelines for a prognostic prediction study, including a risk of bias (ROB) assessment. We report the results based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Studies were primarily framed as PICOTS (population, index, comparator, outcomes, timing, and setting): Population: men or women in procreative management, pregnant women, and fetuses or newborns; Index: multivariable prognostic prediction models using non-LR algorithms for risk classification to inform clinicians' decision making; Comparator: the models applying an LR; Outcomes: pregnancy-related outcomes of procreation or pregnancy outcomes for pregnant women and fetuses or newborns; Timing: pre-, inter-, and peripregnancy periods (predictors), at the pregnancy, delivery, and either puerperal or neonatal period (outcome), and either short- or long-term prognoses (time interval); and Setting: primary care or hospital. The results were synthesized by reporting study characteristics and ROBs and by random effects modeling of the difference of the logit area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of each non-LR model compared with the LR model for the same pregnancy outcomes. We also reported between-study heterogeneity by using {$\tau$}2 and I2. Results: Of the 2093 records, we included 142 studies for the systematic review and 62 studies for a meta-analysis. Most prediction models used LR (92/142, 64.8\%) and artificial neural networks (20/142, 14.1\%) among non-LR algorithms. Only 16.9\% (24/142) of studies had a low ROB. A total of 2 non-LR algorithms from low ROB studies significantly outperformed LR. The first algorithm was a random forest for preterm delivery (logit AUROC 2.51, 95\% CI 1.49-3.53; I2=86\%; {$\tau$}2=0.77) and pre-eclampsia (logit AUROC 1.2, 95\% CI 0.72-1.67; I2=75\%; {$\tau$}2=0.09). The second algorithm was gradient boosting for cesarean section (logit AUROC 2.26, 95\% CI 1.39-3.13; I2=75\%; {$\tau$}2=0.43) and gestational diabetes (logit AUROC 1.03, 95\% CI 0.69-1.37; I2=83\%; {$\tau$}2=0.07). Conclusions: Prediction models with the best performances across studies were not necessarily those that used LR but also used random forest and gradient boosting that also performed well. We recommend a reanalysis of existing LR models for several pregnancy outcomes by comparing them with those algorithms that apply standard guidelines.

  abstract = {The congenital heart disease includes abnormalities in heart structurethat occur before birth. Such defects occur in the fetus while it is developing in the uterus during pregnancy. About 500,000 adults have congenital heart disease in USA (WebMD, Congenital heart defects medications, www.WebMD.com/heart-disease/tc/congenital-heart-defects-medications, 2014). 1 in every 100 children has defects in their heart due to genetic or chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome. The excessive alcohol consumption during pregnancy and use of medications, maternal viral infection, such as Rubella virus, measles (German), in the first trimester of pregnancy, all these are risk factors for congenital heart disease in children, and the risk increases if parent or sibling has a congenital heart defect. These are heart valves defects, atrial and ventricular septa defects, stenosis, the heart muscle abnormalities, and a hole inside wall of the heart which causes defect in blood circulation, heart failure, and eventual death. There are no particular symptoms of congenital heart disease, but shortness of breath and limited ability to do exercise, fatigue, abnormal sound of heart as heart murmur, which is diagnosed by a physician while listening to the heart beats. The echocardiogram or transesophageal echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, cardiac catheterization, and MRI methods are used to detect congenital heart disease. Several medications are given depending on the severity of this disease, and catheter method and surgery are required for serious cases to repair heart valves or heart transplantation as in endocarditis. For genetic study, first DNA is extracted from blood followed by DNA sequence analysis and any defect in nucleotide sequence of DNA is determined. For congenital heart disease, genes in chromosome 1 show some defects in nucleotide sequence. In this review the causes, diagnosis, symptoms, and treatments of congenital heart disease are described.},

  abstract = {Objective Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) has been implemented in China since 2004 and has expanded into a nationwide programme. This study aims to evaluate changes in social functioning, family relations and drug-related criminal behaviour among MMT clients in China. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Both English and Chinese literature databases, including PubMed, Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Journals Database (CQVIP), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang Data, were comprehensively searched over the period 2004--2014 for studied indicators. Study selection, quality assessment and data extraction were conducted according to the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) Statement. Meta-analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Biostat software. Results Thirty-eight articles were included in this review (1 in English and 37 in Chinese). The self-reported arrest rate decreased from 13.1\% (95\% CI 9.1\% to 18.5\%) at baseline to 3.4\% (95\% CI 1.5\% to 7.7\%) and 4.3\% (95\% CI 1.6\% to 11.4\%) after 6 and 12\>months of MMT intervention, respectively. The rate of drug selling decreased from 7.6\% (95\% CI 3.8\% to 14.8\%) at baseline to 1.9\% (95\% CI 0.6\% to 6.2\%) and 3.0\% (95\% CI 1.0\% to 8.9\%) after 6 and 12\>months of intervention, respectively. Similarly, the rates of selling sex for drugs and drug-related crime decreased from 5.3\% (95\% CI 2.4\% to 11.1\%) and 9.9\% (95\% CI 6.8\% to 14.2\%) at baseline to 1.1\% (95\% CI 0.5\% to 2.3\%) and 3.4\% (95\% CI 2.5\% to 4.5\%) at 6\>months, then to 0.8\% (95\% CI 0.3\% to 1.9\%) and 3.4\% (95\% CI 0.8\% to 13.1\%) at 12\>months after treatment initiation, respectively. In contrast, the rate of employment of clients and the proportion of clients having a good relationship with their family increased substantially from 26.4\% (95\% CI 22.9\% to 30.1\%) and 37.9\% (95\% CI 32.0\% to 44.2\%) to 41.6\% (95\% CI 36.6\% to 48.0\%) and 59.6\% (95\% CI 48.1\% to 70.2\%) at 6\>months, then to 59.8\% (95\% CI 52.4\% to 66.8\%) and 75.0\% (95\% CI 69.0\% to 80.2\%) at 12\>months after treatment initiation, respectively. Conclusions MMT has significantly reduced criminal activity, and improved employment rate and social well-being, of clients of the MMT programme. MMT is an effective measure to help drug users to resume societal and familial functions in China.},

Several clinical forms of {$\alpha$}-thalassaemia and {$\beta$}-thalassaemia, including the co-inheritance of {$\beta$}-thalassaemia with haemoglobin E resulting in haemoglobin E/{$\beta$}-thalassaemia, have been described. The disease hallmarks include imbalance in the {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$}-globin chain ratio, ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic haemolytic anaemia, compensatory haemopoietic expansion, hypercoagulability, and increased intestinal iron absorption. The complications of iron overload, arising from transfusions that represent the basis of disease management in most patients with severe thalassaemia, might further complicate the clinical phenotype. These pathophysiological mechanisms lead to an array of clinical manifestations involving numerous organ systems. Conventional management primarily relies on transfusion and iron-chelation therapy, as well as splenectomy in specific cases. An increased understanding of the molecular and pathogenic factors that govern the disease process have suggested routes for the development of new therapeutic approaches that address the underlying chain imbalance, ineffective erythropoiesis, and iron dysregulation, with several agents being evaluated in preclinical models and clinical trials.},

Some thalassemia intermedia patients are asymptomatic until adult life, whereas others are symptomatic from as young as 2~years of age. A number of clinical complications commonly associated with thalassemia intermedia are rarely seen in thalassemia major, including extramedullary hematopoiesis, leg ulcers, gallstones and thrombophilia. Prevention of these complications, possibly with blood transfusion therapy, is ideal since they may be difficult to manage. Currently, many patients with thalassemia intermedia receive only occasional or no transfusions, since they are able to maintain hemoglobin levels between 7--9~g/dl; the risk of iron overload, necessitating adequate chelation therapy, is also a contributing factor. At present, there are no clear guidelines for initiating and maintaining transfusions in thalassemia intermedia for the prevention or treatment of complications. Here, we review the major clinical complications in thalassemia intermedia and suggest some therapeutic strategies based on retrospective clinical observations.},

Hb Bart syndrome, the more severe form, is characterized by prenatal onset of generalized edema and pleural and pericardial effusions as a result of congestive heart failure induced by severe anemia. Extramedullary erythropoiesis, marked hepatosplenomegaly, and a massive placenta are common. Death usually occurs in the neonatal period. HbH disease has a broad phenotypic spectrum: although clinical features usually develop in the first years of life, HbH disease may not present until adulthood or may be diagnosed only during routine hematologic analysis in an asymptomatic individual. The majority of individuals have enlargement of the spleen (and less commonly of the liver), mild jaundice, and sometimes thalassemia-like bone changes. Individuals with HbH disease may develop gallstones and experience acute episodes of hemolysis in response to infections or exposure to oxidant drugs., The diagnosis of Hb Bart syndrome is established in a fetus with characteristic hematologic and hemoglobin (Hb) findings and molecular genetic testing that identifies biallelic pathogenic variants in both HBA1 and HBA2 that result in deletion or inactivation of all four {$\alpha$}-globin alleles. The diagnosis of HbH disease is established in a proband with hematologic and Hb findings and molecular genetic testing that identifies biallelic pathogenic variants in HBA1 and HBA2 that result in deletion or inactivation of three {$\alpha$}-globin alleles., Treatment of manifestations: Hb Bart syndrome: intrauterine blood transfusions, improved transfusion strategies, and rarely curative hematopoietic stem cell transplant may allow survival of children. HbH disease: while most individuals are clinically well and survive without any treatment, occasional red blood cell transfusions may be needed during hemolytic or aplastic crises. Red blood cell transfusions are very rarely needed for severe anemia affecting cardiac function and erythroid expansion that results in severe bone changes and extramedullary erythropoiesis. In contrast, persons with non-deletional HbH disease may be more severely affected and transfusion dependent. Prevention of primary manifestations: Because of the severity of Hb Bart syndrome, the occasional presence of congenital anomalies, and the risk for maternal complications, prenatal testing and early termination of pregnancies at risk have usually been considered. However, recent advances in intrauterine and postnatal therapy have increased treatment options, thus complicating the ethical issues for health care providers and families facing an affected pregnancy. Prevention of secondary complications: Monitor individuals with HbH disease for hemolytic/aplastic crisis during febrile episodes; in those who require chronic red blood cell transfusions, iron chelation therapy should be instituted; for those who are not red blood cell transfusion dependent, iron chelation with deferasirox can be considered to reduce liver iron concentration. Surveillance: For HbH disease, hematologic evaluation every six to 12 months; assessment of growth and development in children every six to 12 months; monitoring of iron load with serum ferritin concentration and periodic quantitative measurement of liver iron concentration. Agents/circumstances to avoid: In persons with HbH disease: inappropriate iron therapy and oxidant drugs (i.e., the same drugs to be avoided by individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency). Evaluation of relatives at risk: Test the sibs of a proband as soon as possible after birth for HbH disease so that monitoring can be instituted. Pregnancy management: Complications reported in pregnant women with HbH disease include worsening anemia, preeclampsia, congestive heart failure, and threatened miscarriage; monitoring for these issues during pregnancy is recommended., Alpha-thalassemia is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Hb Bart syndrome. At conception, each sib of a proband with Hb Bart syndrome has a 25\% chance of having Hb Bart syndrome (e.g., --/--), a 50\% chance of having {$\alpha$}-thalassemia trait with deletion or inactivation of two {$\alpha$}-globin genes in cis (e.g., --/{$\alpha\alpha$}), and a 25\% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.

Prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing may be carried out for couples who are at high risk of having a fetus with Hb Bart syndrome or for a pregnancy in which one parent is a known {$\alpha$}-thalassemia carrier with a two-gene deletion in cis (--/{$\alpha\alpha$}) when the other parent is either unknown or unavailable for testing.},

  abstract = {For the last two decades, oversampling has been employed to overcome the challenge of learning from imbalanced datasets. Many approaches to solving this challenge have been offered in the literature. Oversampling, on the other hand, is a concern. That is, models trained on fictitious data may fail spectacularly when put to real-world problems. The fundamental difficulty with oversampling approaches is that, given a real-life population, the synthesized samples may not truly belong to the minority class. As a result, training a classifier on these samples while pretending they represent minority may result in incorrect predictions when the model is used in the real world. We analyzed a large number of oversampling methods in this paper and devised a new oversampling evaluation system based on hiding a number of majority examples and comparing them to those generated by the oversampling process. Based on our evaluation system, we ranked all these methods based on their incorrectly generated examples for comparison. Our experiments using more than 70 oversampling methods and nine imbalanced real-world datasets reveal that all oversampling methods studied generate minority samples that are most likely to be majority. Given data and methods in hand, we argue that oversampling in its current forms and methodologies is unreliable for learning from class imbalanced data and should be avoided in real-world applications.},

  abstract = {Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) enables accurate detection of fetal chromosomal trisomies. The majority of publicly available computational methods for sequencing-based NIPT analyses rely on low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data and are not applicable for targeted high-coverage sequencing data from cell-free DNA samples. Here, we present a novel computational framework for a targeted high-coverage sequencing-based NIPT analysis. The developed framework uses a hidden Markov model (HMM) in conjunction with a supplemental machine learning model, such as decision tree (DT) or support vector machine (SVM), to detect fetal trisomy and parental origin of additional fetal chromosomes. These models were developed using simulated datasets covering a wide range of biologically relevant scenarios with various chromosomal quantities, parental origins of extra chromosomes, fetal DNA fractions, and sequencing read depths. Developed models were tested on simulated and experimental targeted sequencing datasets. Consequently, we determined the functional feasibility and limitations of each proposed approach and demonstrated that read count-based HMM achieved the best overall classification accuracy of 0.89 for detecting fetal euploidies and trisomies on simulated dataset. Furthermore, we show that by using the DT and SVM on the HMM classification results, it was possible to increase the final trisomy classification accuracy to 0.98 and 0.99, respectively. We demonstrate that read count and allelic ratio-based models can achieve a high accuracy (up to 0.98) for detecting fetal trisomy even if the fetal fraction is as low as 2\%. Currently, existing commercial NIPT analysis requires at least 4\% of fetal fraction, which can be possibly a challenge in case of early gestational age ({$<$}10 weeks) or high maternal body mass index ({$>$}35 kg/m2). More accurate detection can be achieved at higher sequencing depth using HMM in conjunction with supplemental models, which significantly improve the trisomy detection especially in borderline scenarios (e.g., very low fetal fraction) and enables to perform NIPT even earlier than 10 weeks of pregnancy.},

Reducing waiting time benefits not only patients but also hospitals in decreasing overall workload. To identify factors contributing to long waiting time in outpatient clinics, a cross-sectional study was conducted at a national hospital in Vietnam. The time for each process of 7,931 patients who visited the outpatient clinics within Thong Nhat Hospital from 5 to 9 September 2016 was collected from the computerized clinical database. Characteristics of patients (age, sex, address, day of visit, registration time, visited department and test) and waiting times were studied at the outcome measures. Multivariate analyses using the linear regression model was carried out to evaluate the contribution of these factors to the total waiting time. Among 7,931 patients, 52.3\% were women, 46.3\% were 60--80 years, and 64.8\% registered between 5:30 and 9:30. The mean total waiting time was 104.1 minutes. The analysis on total waiting time among 4,564 patients who visited one department without any test showed that department group and registration time were significantly associated with a total waiting time. In 1,259 patients who visited one department with one test, early registration and undergoing blood tests were significantly associated with a longer total waiting time. These results showed that old age, visiting internal medicine departments, early registration time, and undergoing blood tests were factors contributing to a longer total waiting time in the outpatient clinics within Thong Nhat Hospital.},

Similar programs in developing countries especially Southeast Asia, are more problematic because both {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} thalassemias are highly prevalent. In Thailand, there are limited data on whether we could determine, based on hematological phenotypes, the mutation severity and/or coinheritance of {$\alpha$} thalassemia in {$\beta$} thalassemia traits. Methods: Comprehensive molecular, hematology and hemoglobin analyses of the {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} globin genes were performed in 141 healthy individuals identified as {$\beta$} thalassemia carriers. Results: Seventeen different {$\beta$} globin mutations were successfully identified out of all cases analyzed. Although the majority of the mutations identified were the {$\beta$} 0 or severe {$\beta$} + thalassemia alleles, a high proportion of mild mutations (25\%) was observed. Of these {$\beta$} thalassemia traits, 22.3\% were found to co-inherit the {$\alpha$} thalassemias. Milder hematological phenotypes were noted in {$\beta$} + compared with {$\beta$} 0 thalassemia traits when the {$\alpha$} globin genes were intact. Although co-inheritance of {$\alpha$} 0 thalassemia might be suspected in cases with skewed profiles, due to the overlapping values, it remains difficult to apply these parameters for reliable carrier determination. Conclusions: A combination of hemoglobin analysis and DNA testing seems to be the best way to confirm carrier status in a region with high frequency for both {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} thalassemias. Underdiagnoses of carrier status could hamper the effectiveness of a thalassemia prevention and control program.},

Croatia has no current official recommendations for folic acid use for women who are planning pregnancy or are already pregnant, and there is no fortification of staple foods with FA. Methods. Sample consisted of women who delivered at the Clinical Hospital Center Petrova, and a County hospital in Po{\v z}ega, They were interviewed by trained medical technician or nurse about their knowledge, believes and use of FA. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, binary logistic regression and the {$\chi$}2 test. Also we searched the market for availability of food supplements containing FA. Results: Among 603 women, 432 (71.7\%) planned the current pregnancy, 306 (50.7\%) did not take any vitamin supplement; 170 (28.2\%) took some multivitamin supplements, and only 127 (21.1\%) took FA supplements. Of those who have taken supplements, 58 (19.5\%) decided to take FA on their own, 64 (21.5\%) based on recommendations from a physician and several mentioned other sources (nurse, pharmacists, family member or media). In total 287 (47.6\%) did not know what FA is. Logistic regression analysis showed that planned pregnancy is the strongest positive predictor for taking FA, while smoking and number of pregnancies are negative predictors. Conclusion. Awareness of FA role and its requirements before and during pregnancy is low among interviewed women. Better education for, both, women and health care professionals, as well as need for fortification of some staple food are recognized as important public health priorities in Croatia.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates labor market dynamics for physicians in Vietnam, paying particular attention to geographic distribution and dual job holding. The analysis is based on a survey of a random sample of physicians in 3 regions in 2009--10. We found that the labor market for physicians in Vietnam is characterized by very little movement among both facility levels and geographic areas. Dual practice is also prominent, with over one-third of physicians holding a second job. After taking account of the various sources of income for physicians and controlling for key factors, there is a significant wage premium associated with locating in an urban area. This premium is driven by much higher earnings from dual job holding rather than official earnings in the primary job. There are important policy implications that emerge. With such low job turnover rates, policies to increase the number of physicians in rural areas could focus on initial recruitment. Once in place, physicians tend to remain in their jobs for a very long time. Lastly, findings from an innovative discrete choice experiment suggest that providing long-term education and improving equipment are the most effective instruments to recruit physicians to work in rural areas.},

We show that unsupervised learning techniques can be readily used to identify phases and phases transitions of many-body systems. Starting with raw spin configurations of a prototypical Ising model, we use principal component analysis to extract relevant low-dimensional representations of the original data and use clustering analysis to identify distinct phases in the feature space. This approach successfully finds physical concepts such as the order parameter and structure factor to be indicators of a phase transition. We discuss the future prospects of discovering more complex phases and phase transitions using unsupervised learning techniques.},

We evaluate whether secondary substance use modifies the association between treatment and primary drug use among primary heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine (MA) users. Methods Data were obtained from prospective cohort studies on people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) in California, USA. Using repeated monthly data on self-reported secondary substance use (heroin, cocaine, MA, alcohol or marijuana; {$\geq$}1 day in a month), primary drug use ({$\geq$}1 day in a month), and treatment participation, collected via timeline follow-back, we fitted generalized linear mixed multiple regression models controlling for potential confounders to examine the interactions between treatment and secondary substance use on the odds of primary heroin, cocaine and MA use, respectively. Results Included in our study were 587 primary heroin, 444 primary MA, and 501 primary cocaine users, with a median of 32.4, 13.3 and 18.9 years of follow-up, respectively. In the absence of secondary substance use, treatment was strongly associated with decreased odds of primary drug use (adjusted odds ratios (aORs): 0.25, 95\% CI: 0.24, 0.27, 0.07 (0.06, 0.08), and 0.07 (0.07, 0.09)) for primary heroin, MA, and cocaine users, respectively. Secondary substance use of any kind moderated these associations (0.82 (0.78, 0.87), 0.25 (0.21, 0.30) and 0.53 (0.45, 0.61), respectively), and these findings were consistent for each type of secondary substance considered. Moreover, we observed different associations in terms of direction and magnitude between secondary substance use and primary drug use during off-treatment periods across substance types. Conclusions This study demonstrates secondary substance use moderates the temporal associations between treatment and primary drug use among primary heroin, MA and cocaine users. Disparate patterns of polydrug use require careful measurement and analysis to inform targeted treatment for polydrug users.},

Data held by the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies database were analysed on all the cases from 16 population-based registries in 11 European countries diagnosed prenatally or before 1 year of age, and delivered between 2000 and 2006. Cases were all unbalanced chromosome abnormalities and included live births, fetal deaths from 20 weeks gestation and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly. There were 10,323 cases with a chromosome abnormality, giving a total birth prevalence rate of 43.8/10,000 births. Of these, 7335 cases had trisomy 21,18 or 13, giving individual prevalence rates of 23.0, 5.9 and 2.3/10,000 births, respectively (53, 13 and 5\% of all reported chromosome errors, respectively). In all, 473 cases (5\%) had a sex chromosome trisomy, and 778 (8\%) had 45,X, giving prevalence rates of 2.0 and 3.3/10,000 births, respectively. There were 1,737 RCA cases (17\%), giving a prevalence of 7.4/10,000 births. These included triploidy, other trisomies, marker chromosomes, unbalanced translocations, deletions and duplications. There was a wide variation between the registers in both the overall prenatal diagnosis rate of RCA, an average of 65\% (range 5-92\%) and the prevalence of RCA (range 2.4-12.9/10,000 births). In all, 49\% were liveborn. The data provide the prevalence of families currently requiring specialised genetic counselling services in the perinatal period for these conditions and, for some, long-term care.},

  abstract = {For centuries, China has had the world's largest population, although it will soon lose that title to India. When Mao Zedong and his colleagues seized national power in 1949, they were not sure how many Chinese there were (the first modern census was not conducted until 1953), and Mao initially argued that having a large and rapidly increasing population was a blessing for China, rather than a curse. However, the challenges of managing such a large and poor country soon changed the official view, and during some intervals in the 1950s and 1960s, China carried out voluntary family planning campaigns to try to reduce the birth rate. However, those campaigns were largely ineffective, with the only notable decline in fertility during those decades produced by the Great Leap Forward--induced mass famine of 1959--1961, not family planning efforts. As of 1970 the projected number of babies the average Chinese mother would have in her lifetime (termed the total fertility rate [TFR]) was still close to six. (China's cities, where less than 20 percent of the population lived at the time, is an exception to these generalizations, with the 1960s family planning campaign playing some role in reducing the urban TFR in 1970 to 3.2.) Early in the 1970s, when Mao was still in charge (he died in 1976), China made a dramatic shift from voluntary family planning to mandatory birth limits under the slogan, ``later (marriage ages), longer (birth intervals), and fewer'' (births---no more than two babies for urban families and three for rural families). The ``later, longer, fewer'' campaign was enforced very strictly, using many of the coercive measures that later became notorious during the one-child campaign, and China's fertility rate fell dramatically, to less than three per mother by the end of the decade. Despite this success, in 1980 the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) launched an even more demanding and coercive campaign that attempted for the next thirty-five years to limit Chinese families to having only one child. The fertility rate actually went up in the early 1980s but then began to decline again, reaching subreplacement fertility (TFR = 2.1) by the early 1990s. Most experts estimate that China's TFR fluctuated in the 1.4 to 1.6 range between 2000 and 2015, although some analysts have calculated higher figures, and others lower. The CCP in late 2015 decided to end the one-child limit, with Chinese families since January 1, 2016 allowed to have two children (but no more, at least as of 2019). Debates about the controversial one-child policy have spawned a large literature that examines many issues, including the reasons the CCP launched this campaign, how effective it was in reducing birth rates further, what human rights abuses resulted, how child-rearing and children have been affected, and in what ways Chinese society and the people of China have benefited or have been harmed by the demographic distortions produced by mandatory, state-enforced birth limits.},

  abstract = {In the United States, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer diagnosed among adults and the second leading cause of death from cancer. For this guideline update, the American Cancer Society (ACS) used an existing systematic evidence review of the CRC screening literature and microsimulation modeling analyses, including a new evaluation of the age to begin screening by race and sex and additional modeling that incorporates changes in US CRC incidence. Screening with any one of multiple options is associated with a significant reduction in CRC incidence through the detection and removal of adenomatous polyps and other precancerous lesions and with a reduction in mortality through incidence reduction and early detection of CRC. Results from modeling analyses identified efficient and model-recommendable strategies that started screening at age 45 years. The ACS Guideline Development Group applied the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria in developing and rating the recommendations. The ACS recommends that adults aged 45 years and older with an average risk of CRC undergo regular screening with either a high-sensitivity stool-based test or a structural (visual) examination, depending on patient preference and test availability. As a part of the screening process, all positive results on noncolonoscopy screening tests should be followed up with timely colonoscopy. The recommendation to begin screening at age 45 years is a qualified recommendation. The recommendation for regular screening in adults aged 50 years and older is a strong recommendation. The ACS recommends (qualified recommendations) that: 1) average-risk adults in good health with a life expectancy of more than 10 years continue CRC screening through the age of 75 years; 2) clinicians individualize CRC screening decisions for individuals aged 76 through 85 years based on patient preferences, life expectancy, health status, and prior screening history; and 3) clinicians discourage individuals older than 85 years from continuing CRC screening. The options for CRC screening are: fecal immunochemical test annually; high-sensitivity, guaiac-based fecal occult blood test annually; multitarget stool DNA test every 3 years; colonoscopy every 10 years; computed tomography colonography every 5 years; and flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To characterize determinants of folic acid (FA) use among women of reproductive age and patient education practices of health care professionals in one region of Honduras. METHODS: 508 female outpatients and 128 health workers were interviewed in six primary care clinics in Honduras. Results were analyzed using univariate and multivariate regression models. RESULTS: The survey showed that 45\% patients were familiar with FA. Of that number, 30\% knew appropriate timing of consumption and 25\% reported proper pre-natal supplementation. Increasing education was strongly correlated with knowledge of folic acid function (OR=252.52, P{$<$}0.0001) and actual use (OR=12.65, P{$<$}0.000). Age is associated with knowledge of proper timing of FA usage (OR=3.94, P{$<$}0.01). Most women learned about FA from medical professionals, but only half of providers educate their female patients about FA. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare providers should remember to discuss the role of folic acid with their patients, particularly those of low education and at the extremes of reproductive age. While long-term efforts to develop fortification programs continue, interim Honduran health campaigns to increase proper consumption of folic acid should target these particularly vulnerable populations.},

It has been suggested, however, that the long term survival is better than was previously thought and that cardiac surgery may be justified. This population based study reviews the incidence, antenatal diagnosis, spectrum of survival from congenital heart disease, and mode of death for patients with trisomy 13 in the Northern Health Region from 1985 to 1992. There was an observed prevalence at birth of 0.049/1000 live births and an expected prevalence, allowing for antenatal diagnosis, of 0.077. None of the cardiac lesions found would cause early death. The median survival in this series was four days; the longest survival was 3.5 months. The principal mode of death was apnoea in 14 of 16 children, irrespective of the presence of a cranial abnormality. In the light of these findings, cardiac surgery cannot be justified in patients with trisomy 13.},

Although Z-test is widely used in NIPT NGS data analysis, there is still necessity to improve its accuracy for reducing a) false negatives and false positives, and b) the ratio of unclassified data, so as to lower the potential harm to patients as well as the induced cost of retests. Combining the multiple Z-tests with indexes of clinical signs and quality control, features were collected from the known samples and scaled for model training using support vector machine (SVM). We trained SVM models from the qualified NIPT NGS data that Z-test can discriminate and tested the performance on the data that Z-test cannot discriminate. On screenings of 13-/18-/21-trisomies, the trained SVM models achieved 100\% accuracies in both internal validations and unknown sample predictions. It is shown that other machine learning (ML) models can also achieve similar high accuracy, and SVM model is most robust in this study. Moreover, four false positives and four false negatives caused by Z-test were corrected by using the SVM models. To our knowledge, this is one of the earliest studies to employ SVM in NIPT NGS data analysis. It is expected to replace Z-test in clinical practice.},

Until recently, the cause of the majority of CHD was unknown. Advances in genomic technologies have discovered the genetic causes of a significant fraction of CHD, while at the same time pointing to remarkable complexity in CHD genetics. This review will focus on the evidence for genetic causes underlying CHD and discuss data supporting both monogenic and complex genetic mechanisms underlying CHD. The discoveries from CHD genetic studies draw attention to biological pathways that simultaneously open the door to a better understanding of cardiac development and affect clinical care of patients with CHD. Finally, we address clinical genetic evaluation of patients and families affected by CHD.},

  abstract = {Thalassemia is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder with microcytic hypochromic anemia resulting from reduced or absent synthesis of 1 or more of the globin chains of hemoglobin. This study provided the insight into prevalence and molecular characterization of thalassemia in Hakka population. 14,524 unrelated subjects were included in our study from January 2015 to November 2017. All the subjects were detected by hematological analysis, hemoglobin electrophoresis analysis, and molecular diagnosis (gap-polymerase chain reaction and flow-through hybridization technology). Data analysis was used to compare allele frequencies between the Hakka populations. Seven thousand four hundred twenty-two cases of microcytosis were found. The percentage of microcytosis in Meizhou, Ganzhou, and Heyuan was 50.91\% (6738/13,236), 51.27\% (445/868), and 56.90\% (239/420), respectively. A total of 5516 mutant chromosomes were identified, including 3775 {$\alpha$}-thalassemia and 1741 {$\beta$}-thalassemia. --/{$\alpha\alpha$} was the most common {$\alpha$}-thalassemia genotype, followed by -{$\alpha$}/{$\alpha\alpha$} and -{$\alpha$}/{$\alpha\alpha$}, accounted for 84.92\% of {$\alpha$}-thalassemia genotypes. Twelve kinds of mutations and 26 genotypes in {$\beta$}-thalassemia were found. IVS-II-654(C{$\rightarrow$}T), CD41-42(-TCTT), -28(A{$\rightarrow$}G), and CD17(A{$\rightarrow$}T) alleles accounted for 92.65\% of these mutations. IVS-II-654/N, CD41-42/N, -28/N, CD17/N genotypes accounted for 91.53\% of {$\beta$}-thalassemia genotypes. 27 fetuses with at-risk pregnancies were subjected to prenatal diagnosis. Five fetuses were Bart's hydrops syndrome and 2 fetuses with {$\beta$}-thalassemia major. There were some differences in molecular characterization of thalassemia among Hakka people in different areas of southern China. Our results enriched the related information of thalassemia in the region, which provided valuable references for the prevention and control of thalassemia.},
